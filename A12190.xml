            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17937:23"/> hearts wee often find in our ſelves. It were a ſtrange thing to ſee a wife have have words enough for her maids and ſervants: and yet not to bee able to ſpeake to her husband. Wee all profeſſe to bee the Spouſe of Chriſt, what a ſtrange thing then is it, to bee full when wee ſpeake to men, yet be ſo emptie and want words to ſpeake to him. A begger wee know wants no words, nay, he aboundeth with variety of expreſſions, and what makes him thus fruitfull in words:<note place="margin">What makes a bold begger.</note> his neceſſity and in part his hope of obtaining.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two make beggers ſo earneſt. So would it be with us, if we found ſufficiently our great <hi>need</hi> of Chriſt; and therewith had <hi>hope,</hi> it would embolden us ſo to go to God in Chriſt, that we ſhould not want words: but wee want this <hi>hope</hi> and the feeling of our neceſſities, which makes us ſo barren in prayer.</p>
                     <p>Prepare thy ſelfe therfore to prayer by getting unto thee <hi>a true ſenſe of thy need: acquaintance with God, and hope to obtaine,</hi> and it will make thee fervent in prayer, and copious in thy requeſts.</p>

And many times the greater ſinners he dealt with, the greater mercies and tender bowells of compaſſion were opened unto them, in many ſweet and gratious promiſes tendering forgiveneſſe, and inviting to Repentance, as here in this Chapter and whole Prophecie is ſhewed: what Tribe ſo wicked, ſo full of Idolatry and Rebellion as <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and yet here <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> are taught a leſſon of Repentance: as the tender Nurſe feeds her childe and puts meate in its mouth, ſo here the Lord puts words in the mouth of this Rebellious people.</p>

                     <p>Therefore ſince all <hi>good</hi> comes from God, the firſt and chiefe good, let us labour to have communion with him by all ſanctified meanes, that ſo hee may take away our ill, and doe us every way good, to our ſoules, bodies, conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17937:34"/> and returne nothing; for then the inter-courſe betwixt God and us is cut off. Therefore the ſame Spirit which teaches them to pray, and to <hi>Take to them words;</hi> teacheth them likewiſe to take unto them <hi>words of Praiſe,</hi> that there may bee a <hi>Rendring,</hi> according to <hi>Receiving;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we are worſe then the pooreſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is, which rendreth according to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. The <hi>Earth</hi> (when it is plowed and ſowed) it yeelds us fruit. <hi>Trees</hi> being ſet, yeeld increaſe: Beaſts being fed, render in their kind: yea the fierceſt untamed Beaſts,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.10.</note> (as we reade of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) have been thankfull in their kinde; The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) declare the glory of God and the firmament ſhewes forth his Praiſe. So there muſt be a Returne, if we be not worſe then beaſts. Therefore the Church here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth a Returne by the ſame Spirit which ſtirred her up to pray. <hi>So will wee render the Calves of our lips.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this promiſe which the Church makes here of praiſe is a kinde of vow: <hi>So will we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> &amp;c. To binde ones ſelfe is a kinde of vow. The Church therefore bindes her ſelfe that ſhe may binde God; for binding her ſelfe by vow to Thankfullneſſe, ſhe thereby bindes God, who is mooved with nothing wee can doe ſo much as with ſetting forth of his Praiſe, which was his end in all the Creation, the ſetting forth of his glory. The end of the new Creature, is the end of all things both in nature and grace; the end whereof is Gods glory from whence all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17937:35"/> things come, and wherein all things end: as we ſay of a circle, all things begin and ends in it. All other things are for man, and man for Gods glory; when the ſoule can ſay, Lord, this ſhall be for thy honour to ſet forth thy praiſe, it bindes God. Hence that they might moove God to yeeld to their prayers, they bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a kinde of vow; Doe thus, O Lord, and thou ſhalt not looſe by it, thou ſhalt have praiſe, <hi>So will wee render thee the Calves of our lips.</hi>

                     <p>So, Promiſes and vowes of praiſe are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged as an argument to prevaile with God, for the obtaining of that the Church begs for; <hi>So will wee render,</hi> &amp;c.

                           <hi>2.</hi> To be a bridle to our incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,</note> ſo we are inconſtant, in which reſpect, it is a tie to our inconſtant and unſteady nature, for there are none who have the Spirit of God at all with any tenderneſſe of heart, but will thus thinke; I have vowed to God, if it be a heinous thing to break with men, what is it wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to break with the great God? a vow is a kinde of oath; this is the ſacrifice of fooles, to come to God, and yet neither to make good our vowes, nor indeavour to doe it.</p>
                     <p>Let us conſider therefore, what we have done in this caſe. By permiſſion of authority there was a Faſt lately when wee all renewed our vowes (wee mocked God elſe) received the Communion. Will God be mocked thinke you? No, but howſoever man may forget, God will not, but will come upon us, for non-paiment of our vowes and Covenants. Lay we it to heart therefore what Covenants wee have made with God of late. And then, for the time to come, be not diſcouraged if you have beene faulty in it. There is a generall vow, wherein though we have failed (if wee bee his children and break not with God in the maine, cleaving to him in purpoſe of heart, occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renewing our purpoſes and Covenants) yet let not Satan diſcourage us for our unfaithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

                     </p>
                     <p>It was the cuſtome under the Jewiſh pollicie (you know) to offer ſacrifices of all ſorts.

This is the ſtate of a Chriſtian who hath denied himſelfe, for wee cannot beleeve as we ſhould, unleſſe wee denie our ſelves.

                     <p>
                        <hi>But glorifying of God</hi> in ſetting out his praiſe; otherwiſe to thanke God for his goodneſſe to us, or for what wee hope to receive, without glorifying of him, is nothing at all worth. For in glorifying there are two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>A ſuppoſition of Excellencie,</hi> for that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be glorified which hath no excellencie in it; glory in ſublimity, hath alway excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie attending it. And</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The manifeſtation of this glory.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That the yeelding of praiſe to God, is a wondrous acceptable Sacrifice.</hi>

                        </gap>) ſpeech, ſignifieth both <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Speech,</hi> there being one word in the learned language for both.

The Prophet ſaith, <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule, and all that is within mee, bleſſe his holy Name;</hi> Praiſe muſt come from a ſound judgement of the worth of the thing we praiſe God for. It muſt come from an affection which deſires that God may have the glory, by the powers of the whole inward man, which is a hard matter to rouze up our ſelves to praiſe God with all the powers of our ſoule, <hi>all that is within me, praiſe his holy Name.</hi> There goeth Judgement, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the will, ſtrength of affections, and all with it.</p>
                     <p>And then againe, beſides this, <hi>The Calves of our lips,</hi> carries us to worke. The orall Thankeſgiving muſt bee juſtified by our works and deeds; or elſe, our actions will give our tongue the lie, that wee praiſe him with the one, but denie him in the other. This is a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lociſme,

This makes us praiſe God before hand for all favours: as bleſſed <hi>Peter</hi> begins his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. <hi>Bleſſed bee the God and Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt;</hi>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17937:41"/> fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for you,</hi> &amp;c. As ſoone as we are new borne, wee are begotten to a Kingdome, and an Inheritance: therefore aſſurance that we are Gods children, will make us thankfull for grace preſent and that to come, as if we were in Heaven already; we begin then the imployment of Heaven in thankeſgiving here to praiſe God before hand with <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi> and <hi>Angels.</hi> Let us then be ſtirred up, to give God his due before hand, to begin Heaven upon Earth; for wee are ſo much in heaven already as we abound and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in thankſgiving upon earth.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17937:45"/> wee ought to be abundant in it. For thoſe that begin not Heaven upon earth, of which this praiſe is a maine function, they ſhall never come to Heaven, after they are taken from the earth; for there is no heavenly action, but it is begun upon earth: eſpecially this maine one, of joyning with Angels, Seraphims, and Cherubims in landing God?

                        <note place="margin">Joh. 4.18.</note> when ſhe was put in minde by Chriſt of her particular grand ſinne, that ſhe had beene a light woman and had had many husbands, he whom ſhe lived with now not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her husband.

                     <p>So that, take him in all theſe three relations, he is not to be truſted.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>He is a Creature,</hi> what is a Creature? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as it were, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>all creatures before him are as nothing, and as a very little thing;</hi> and what it is, when he pleaſeth he can diſſolve it into nothing, turne it into duſt. Mans breath is in his noſtrills, all fleſh is graſſe, and all his glory as the flower of graſſe. If a man truſt the creature, he may outlive his truſt, his prop may be taken from him and downe he falls. <hi>Aſhur</hi> muſt not be truſted therfore as a <hi>Creature;</hi> nor as a <hi>Man,</hi> for that brings us within the Curſe: <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.5. Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arme,</hi> &amp;c. So truſting in the creature not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us, but brings us within the Curſe. In that reſpect, <hi>Aſhur</hi> muſt not be truſted.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Aſhur</hi> likewiſe was an Enemy, and a ſecret enemie: for howſoever the ten Tribes unto whom <hi>Hoſea</hi> prophecied were great Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, yet they were ſomewhat better then <hi>Aſhur,</hi> who was without the pale of the Church, and a wholy corrupted Church: therefore they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17937:52"/> were enemies to the ten Tribes, and amongſt other reaſons, becauſe they were not ſo bad as they, nor deeply enough died with Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>Many thinke they may complie with Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in ſome few things to gaine their love, and that there may be a joyning with them in this and that: but doe we thinke that they will ever truſt us for all this? No, they will alway hate us till we be as bad as they, and then they will deſpiſe us, and ſecure themſelves of us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no truſting of Papiſts, as Papiſts: not onely <hi>Creatures,</hi> but as falſe, and as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For this is the nature of wicked men, they will never truſt better then themſelves, till they become as bad as they are, after which they deſpiſe them; ſay they, now we may truſt ſuch and ſuch a one, he is as bad as we, becom'd one of us. Which is the reaſon why ſome of a naughty diſpoſition take away the chaſtity and virginity of mens conſciences, making them take this and that evill courſe: and then they thinke they have ſuch ſafe, being as bad as themſelves. Wherein they deale as <hi>Achitophels</hi> politique diveliſh counſell was,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.21.</note> that <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſhould doe that which was naught, and then he ſhould be ſure that <hi>David</hi> and he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver agree after that: and that then by this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the wicked Jewes ſet on miſchiefe might ſecure themſelves of <hi>Abſolom.</hi> So they, now that they joyne with us, God will forſake them, we ſhall have them our inſtruments for any thing. Firſt, they would have the ten Tribes as bad as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17937:52"/> they, and then gave them the ſlip whenſoever they truſted them.</p>
                     <p>Againe, neither were they to be truſted as <hi>Idolaters,</hi> to have league and ſociety with them. There may be ſome commerce and traffique with them, but amity and truſt none. <hi>Aſhur</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> were horrible Idolaters and therefore not to bee truſted in that reſpect. As we ſee the Prophet in this caſe reprooved good <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat</hi> when he had joyn'd with wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> King of the ten Tribes:<note place="margin">2 Chron. 19.2</note>

For it is an equall fault, to multiplie helpes, and to neglect them: either of both are fatall many times, to multiplie Horſes truſting in them, or to ſpoile Horſes and other helpes vainely, ſo to weaken a Kingdome. Therefore there is a middle way for all outward things, a fit care to ſerve Gods providence, and when we have done truſt in God without tempting of him. For to neglect theſe helpes is to tempt him; and to truſt in them (when we have them) is to commit Idolatry with them. Beware of both theſe extreames, for God will have his providence ſerved in the uſe of lawfull meanes: when there is this great care in a Chriſtian Common-wealth; there is a promiſe of good ſucceſſe: becauſe God is with us: otherwiſe what is all, if he be our enemie?

Then a man hath an eſteeme of God to bee <hi>Elſhady,</hi> All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and all other things to be as they are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; that is, they are ſo to day, as that they may be otherwiſe to morrow: for that is the nature of the creatures, they are in <hi>Potentia,</hi> in a poſſibility to bee other things then they are.

If we be never ſo low, diſpaire not; let us make God ours, who is All-ſufficient and Almighty, and then if wee were brought a hundred times lower then wee are, God will helpe and raiſe us.

So prayers to Saints and Angels, this makes Idols of them, becauſe it inveſts them with properties to know our hearts, which hee muſt know unto whom wee pray. And then, it gives unto them that which is proper to God, Worſhip, and Prayer. But, we muſt call upon none, but whom we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in, and we muſt beleeve in none but God.

So it is in Religion, though it cannot be forced, yet ſuch might afterwards bleſſe God for them who brought them to the meanes, who inſteed of their blindneſſe trained them up in more knowledge, by forcing them to uſe the meanes; for which (when God ſhould open their eyes) they might bleſſe God another day. But this point of groſſe Idolatry (ſo (largely handled in bookes) is onely touched by the way, that wee may hate Idolatry the more: which could not be left out, the words leading to ſay ſomewhat of it, ſeeing how theſe Converts heere hate it, and out of that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17937:63"/> hatred make this profeſſion: <hi>neither will we ſay any more to the workes of our hands, ye are our gods,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all, wee muſt know that there be other Idols then the Idols which wee make with our hands: beſides theſe Religious Idols, there be Secular Idols in the world, ſuch as men ſet up to themſelves in their own hearts. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever takes up the heart moſt, which they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more to then to God, that is their Idoll, their god. A mans <hi>love,</hi> a mans <hi>feare</hi> is his god. If a man feare greatneſſe rather then God, that he had rather diſpleaſe God then any great perſon, they are his Idols for the time.<note place="margin">Pro. 29.25.</note>

                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 73.28.</note> &amp;c. when we ſuffer the ſoule to cleave in affiance to earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, it growes in ſome meaſure to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things adhered to: when wee love the world and earthly things wee are earthly. Till the Spirit of God touch the ſoule (as the loadſtone doth the heavie iron drawing it up as it were) it will cleave to the creature, to baſer things then it ſelfe, and ſo makes the creature an Idoll, which is the common Idolatry of theſe times.

                     <p>Now it is not enough to be found in Religion one way in the maine, but we muſt bee ſound every way, without any touch of Idolatry. In a ſpeciall manner, the Apoſtle calls the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man</hi> an <hi>Idolater,</hi>

Nay, it is a ſigne rather that God intends good; if they make a right uſe of it. God intends Converſion, to tranſlate falſe confidence from the creature to himſelfe, and to learne us to make God wiſe for us. It is a happie thing when in this world God will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint a mans courſes and counſells, and bring
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17937:65"/> him to ſhame, rather then he ſhould goe on and thrive in an evill and carnall courſe, and ſo to end his daies. There is no evidence at all which can be given of a Reprobate, becauſe there may be finall Repentance, Repentance at the laſt. But this is one, and as fearefull a ſigne as may be, to thrive and goe on in an evill courſe to the end. When God ſhall diſappoint and bring a man to ſhame in that he prided in, and built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, It is a good ſigne; if thereupon we take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to turne to God, and lay a better bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome and foundation, as we ſee here, <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, wee will not ride upon Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Therefore the Spirit of God forbeares multiplication of words, and ſets downe this: <hi>For in thee the Fatherleſſe findeth mercy:</hi> and doth not ſay, <hi>in thee will wee truſt,</hi> for that is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whoſoever conceives that God is ſo grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

The Church hath beene a long time like a forlorne widdow as it were; God hath promiſed that he will have a care of the widdow and the fatherleſſe, and ſo he will of his poore Church. We ſee in the parable,<note place="margin">Luk 18.5.</note> the widdow with her importunitie prevailed with an unrighteous Judge: the Church now being like a widdow, what is wanting but a ſpirit of ſupplication and Prayer, which ſpirit if the Church had to wraſtle with God and lay hold upon him as <hi>Iaakob</hi> did,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 12.4. Iſa. 62.7.</note> and not ſuffer God to reſt till he had mercy on his poore Church: Certainely it would be better with it then it is, for God comforteth the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, if one, what will he doe for the whole Spouſe which hath ſo long beene a deſpecable and forlorne widdow. And for the time to come, It ought to miniſter matter of comfort for the Church, certainely, God that is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to the <hi>Fatherleſſe,</hi> he will be mercifull to the poore Church. We ſee in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> though the woeman was perſecuted by the Dragon,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.14.</note> yet there were given two wings of a great Eagle to her that ſhe might flie unto the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17937:71"/> wilderneſſe, where ſhe had a place provided of God. It alludes to the ſtory of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> God provided for them in the wilderneſſe, they had <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven, and water out of the rocke, and till they came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> God provided every way for them in a marvellous manner. So God will be ſure to provide for his in the wilderneſſe of this world, he will have a harbour ſtill for the Church, and a hiding place from the ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my tempeſts of her adverſaries.<note place="margin">Iſa. 4.5, 6.</note> Therefore let us not deſpaire, but ſtirre up a ſpirit of Prayer for the Church: that he who ſhewes mercy to the <hi>fatherleſſe,</hi> and commands mercy to be ſhewed to the widdow; that he would ſhew that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which he requires of us. And why may not we hope and truſt for it? The Church in this world is as it were <hi>a fatherleſſe perſon,</hi> a <hi>Pupill,</hi> an <hi>Orphan,</hi> a <hi>Sheepe</hi> in the midſt of <hi>wolves,</hi> as <hi>Daniell</hi> in the lyons den, as a <hi>ſhip</hi> toſſed in the waves, as a <hi>lillie</hi> among thornes, it is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with enemies, and of it ſelfe, (like the poore ſheepe) is ſhiftleſſe. What is the Church but a company of weake perſons? not ſo witty for the world as worldly wiſe men are, nor ſo ſtrong in the arme of fleſh, nor ſo defenced? but a company of perſons who have a hidden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God, we know not how, and hang as it were by a threed: as the Church in this land, and abroad in other places. The true Church is maintained we know not how: God keepes up Religion, the Church and all, becauſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17937:71"/> he is mercifull to the Fatherleſſe, who have no ſhifting wits as the worldly <hi>Achitophels</hi> have. God is wiſe for them that are not wiſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and powerfull for them, that have little ſtrength of their owne. Therefore, let us not be diſcouraged though we be weake creatures, a little flock, like a company of ſheepe, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we have a ſtrong Sheapheard.<note place="margin">Pſal. 23.1.

So the the Church of God, a number of weake Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans profeſſing Religion, they want many helps, yet God ſupports them, and hath ordained this and that haven for them: as this Magiſtrate, and that Perſon, God hath one ſupport or other for them.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17937:84"/> If the body be extreame cold, we know there is a diſtemper, or if it be extreame hot: ſo if the ſoule be ſo extreame cold, that no heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Motives or ſweet Promiſes can worke upon it, ſtirre it up, then certainely there is a diſeaſe upon the ſoule.</p>
                     <p>If the ſoule be inflamed with Revenge and Anger, that ſoule is certainely diſeaſed: the temper of the ſoule is according to the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, a man may know by his <hi>Paſsions,</hi> when he hath a ſick ſoule.</p>
                     <p>If a man cannot reliſh good diet, then wee count him a ſick man, ſo when a man cannot relliſh holy diſcourſe, nor the Ordinances of God. You have ſome men, that can relliſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but profits and pleaſures, and ſuch vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but no divine thing, ſuch have ſicke ſoules undoubtedly.</p>
                     <p>So againe, a man may know there is a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſickneſſe and ſoreneſſe upon the ſoule, 1 when it is ſenſeleſſe of its wounds, and 2 is ſenſeleſſe of that which paſſeth from it: as men (we ſay) are readie to die, when excrementall things paſſe from them without any ſenſe. So a man may know that he is deſperately ſoule-ſicke, when oathes, lies, and deceitfull ſpeeches paſſe from him, and yet he is ſenſeleſſe of them, they think not of them, they meane no harme: doth that argue a ſound ſtate of body, when a man is ſo deſperately ill, that he feeles not his bodily hurts, and is this a good ſtate of ſoule, when theſe filthy things come out from it inſenſibly?
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17937:85"/> it is an argument of extreame deadneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and irreverence, and of a deſperate ſinne ſick ſoule, when there is no dread or awe of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God; let ſuch looke about them: it is an aggravation of the danger of the ſoule, this kind of temper. We uſually ſay, when the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke is ſo weake that it can hold no nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without caſting it up againe as faſt as it receives it; certainely ſuch a one is ſick and in a dangerous ſtate of body. So when a man heares and heares, and reads and reads, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts nothing into nouriſhment, but all is left where he heard it; it is a ſigne that they have ſicke ſoules, when their retentive power is ſo weake. And there is certainely ſome ſickneſſe, ſome dangerous obſtruction in that ſoule, that cannot digeſt the wholeſome Word of God to make uſe of it; ſome noyſome luſt then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely obſtructs the ſoule which muſt be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out.</p>
                     <p>It is a pittifull thing to ſee the deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of many now, who though they live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tyrannie of ſinne, yet flatter their owne diſeaſe, and account them their greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who any way oppoſe their ſicke humour. What doe they moſt cordially hate? The ſound preaching of the Word; the very ſight of ſuch a one, whoſe calling hath beene to put us in minde of our ſinnes, evill courſes, and vanities of the world, is loathſome and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to carnall men, in whom corruption is growne up to ſuch a tyrannie, that it ſwayes the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17937:85"/> whole ſoule to deviſe how to ſatisfie it. Man is ſo diſeaſed, that thoſe luſts in him (which he ſhould labour to ſubdue and mortifie by the power of the Spirit) doe ſo over-ſway him, that all his life is nothing elſe, but <hi>a diſeaſe and backſliding</hi> into ſinne. And as if we were not corrupt enough our ſelves, how many are there who feed their corruptions, when they frequent ill places and company, whom they cannot bee without, and are as fiſh in the water, feeding the old man in them. So that ſuch are not onely ſick, but defend, maintaine, and feed their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, their whole life being ſpent this way: which they laugh at, and make <hi>Pride their chaine and ornament,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeakes. This is ſpoken that we may take up a lamentation for the vileneſſe of mans nature, and to teach us how to judge aright of men, when they deviſe how to have their liberty ſtrengthened to goe to Hell (as it were) with an high hand: having their will ſo fortified that no man is able to deale with them, thwart them, or teach them any thing. If it were offered to moſt men to have what eſtate they would in this world: what are their wiſhes and deſires? O, that I might live as I liſt, that I m ght have what would content my pleaſures, without controule, that I might have no croſſes, but goe ſmoothly on: yet this which is the deſire of moſt men, is the moſt curſed eſtate of all, and moſt to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

No, it is falſe, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by this place; for how can God heale that he ſees not? He ſees it not to be revenged on them for it, but hee ſees ſinne, to correct it and to heale it. He ſees it not after a revengefull wrathfull juſtice to caſt us into Hell and damne
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17937:102"/> us for it; but he ſees it after a ſort to make us ſmart and lament for it, and to have many times a bitter ſenſe of his wrath and forſaking, as men undone without a new ſupply of comfort and peace from Heaven. Let a man neglect Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, daily ſorrow and confeſſion of ſinne, and now and then even craving new pardon for ſinnes paſt, caſting all upon a fantaſticke conceit of faith in their juſtification: what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, but Pride, Hardneſſe of heart, Contempt of others and neglect of better then themſelves, and proneneſſe, out of Gods judgement, to fall from ill to worſe, from one error to another? In this caſe the heart is falſe and deceitfull, for whilſt it pretends a glorious faith to looke back to Chriſt, to live by faith, and lay all on him by juſtification; it windes it ſelfe out of all taskes of Religion, ſets the heart at liberty, neglects Sanctification and Mortification of luſts, and beautifying the image of God in them, giving too much way to the fleſh.

But, <hi>hee heales our backſlidings,</hi> therefore hee ſees them, for how can he heale a wound, if he ſee it not? He ſees it, but not to their deſtruction who are freely juſtified by his grace.

If he be Wiſe, the more hee will find out my ſinnes; if hee bee Powerfull, and angry, the more he can revenge himſelfe on me: is he Angry and Juſt; the more woe to me.

After which our conſciences will be at peace for other things God hath many ends in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting us: he will humble us, improove our afflictions to the good of others; and will gaine himſelfe honour by our afflictions, ſufferings,<note place="margin">Rom 5.5.</note> and croſſes.

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:17937:121"/> Chriſt is all in all. What large expreſſions are here thinks a prophane heart, what needs this. As if God knew us not better then we know our ſelves. Whenſoever thou art touched in conſcience with the ſence of thy ſinnes, and knoweſt how great, how powerfull, how Holy a God thou haſt to deale with, who can indure no impure thing, thou wilt never find fault with his large expreſſions in his Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; and with the variety of his promiſes, when hee tranſlates out of the booke of nature into his owne booke, all expreſſions of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things to ſpread forth his mercy and love. Is this needleſſe? No, we need all, he that made us, redeemed us, preſerves us, knowes us better then we our ſelves, he who is infinite in wiſedome and love, takes this courſe.</p>
                     <p>And marke againe in the next place, how the Holy Ghoſt fetcheth here this comfort from things that are moſt excellent in their kinde. <hi>They ſhall grow as the Lillie,</hi> that growes fairely and ſpeedily: <hi>And they ſhall take roote as Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non;</hi> to ſhew that a Chriſtian ſhould be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenteſt in his kinde, he compares him in his right temper and ſtate, to the moſt excellent things in nature.

All the excellencies of nature are little enough to ſet out the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a Chriſtian; he muſt be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſingular man. Saith Chriſt, <hi>What ſingular
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:17937:121"/> thing doe yee?</hi> He muſt not be a common man. Therefore, when God would raiſe his people, he tells them, they ſhould not be common men, but grow as <hi>Lillies,</hi> be rooted as <hi>Trees,</hi> fruitfull as <hi>Olives,</hi> and pleaſant beautifull, as the goodly ſweet-ſmelling trees of <hi>Libanus.</hi> How gratiouſly doth God condeſcend unto us, to teach us by outward things, how to helpe our ſoules by our ſenſes: that when we ſee the growth, fruitfulneſſe, and ſweetneſſe of other things; we ſhould call to mind what we ſhould be, and what God hath promiſed we ſhall be, if we take this courſe and order formerly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. Indeed a wiſe Chriſtian indowed with the Spirit of God, extracts a quinteſſence out of every thing; eſpecially from thoſe that God ſingles out to teach him his duty by, when he lookes upon any plant, fruite, or tree that is pleaſant, delightfull, and fruitfull, it ſhould put him in minde of his duty.</p>

                     <p>Theſe ſweet promiſes in their order follow immediately upon this, that God would free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love them, and ceaſe to be angry with them: then he adds the fruits of his love to their ſoules, and the effects of thoſe fruits in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, whence firſt of all we obſerve,</p>

Grace (to many) <hi>falls like the dew,</hi> by little and little, drop and drop, line upon line, it falls ſweetly and undiſcernably upon them at the firſt. Therefore, it is hard to ſet downe the firſt time, ſeeing (as our bleſſed Saviour ſpeakes) grace at the firſt is wondrous little, likened to a graine of Muſtard-ſeed. But though it be ſmall at firſt,<note place="margin">Mark. 4.31, 32.</note> yet nothing is more glorious and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full afterwards, for from a ſmall ſeed, it growes to over-ſpread and be great, ſhooting out branches. And as the roote of <hi>Ieſſe</hi> was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed ſtock and in ſhew a dead roote, yet thence Chriſt roſe, a branch as high as Heaven. So the beginning of a Chriſtian, is deſpiſed and little, like a dead ſtocke as it were,<note place="margin">Pro. 4.18.</note> but they grow upward and upward ſtill, till they come to Heaven it ſelfe. Thus we ſee there is nothing in the world more undiſcernable in the beginning then the worke of grace, which muſt make us not over-curious to examine exactly the firſt beginnings thereof, becauſe it is as the falling of the <hi>Dew</hi> or <hi>the blowing of the winde.</hi>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17937:124"/> in any thing, it doth it mildly and gently. So uſually (unleſſe it be in ſome extraordinary caſe) God workes upon the ſoule by his grace mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſweetly: Grace works ſweetly upon the ſoule, preſerving its freedome, ſo as man when he begins to be good ſhall be freely good from inward principles wrought in him. His judgment ſhall like the courſe hee takes, and be cleane oppoſite to others that are contrary, from an inward principle, as free now in altering his courſe as formerly he was in following the other. There is no violence but in regard of corruption. God works ſtrongly and mildly; ſtrongly for he changeth a ſtone into a fleſhie heart, and yet ſweetly, he breakes not any power of nature, but advanceth it: for grace doth not take away or impriſon nature, but lift it up and ſet it at liberty: for it makes the will ſtronger and freer, the judgment ſounder, the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cleerer, the affections more orderly, it makes all things better, ſo that no violence is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to nature.</p>

So it is with the Grace of Gods Spirit, it cooles the ſoule ſcorched with the ſenſe of Gods Anger, as indeed all our ſoules will be (when we have to

                     <p>So here is a double uſe the Scripture makes of theſe things. 1. The godly man rejoyceth in his condition, and 2.

This is the eſtate of all thoſe who have not a good roote, for ſaith Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.13.</note> 
                        <hi>Every plant that my heavenly Father hath not planted ſhall be rooted up.</hi> It is true of every condition and of every man, if God have not planted him in that excellent ſtate, or doe not in time, he ſhall be rooted up: for the time will come that the earth will hold him no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he rootes himſelfe now in the earth, which then ſhall caſt him out. He cannot ſtay here long, Heaven will not receive him, then Hell muſt. What a miſerable thing is this, when wee place and bottome our ſelves upon things that will not laſt? when our ſelves ſhall out-laſt our foundation? when a man ſhall live for ever and that which he builds on is fading, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamitie of folly is this? to build on Riches, Favour, Greatneſſe, Power, Inheritance, which either muſt be taken from him, or he from

Now onely a Chriſtian plants his heart and affections on that which is everlaſting, of equall continuance with his ſoule: as he ſhall live for ever, ſo hee is rooted for ever in that which muſt make him everlaſtingly happy.

This is a temptation that old men are ſubject too eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in whom the heate of nature decayes, who thinke withall that grace decayes. But it is not ſo, for ofttimes when grace is carried with the heate of nature, it makes a greater ſhew being helpt by nature. The demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not the truth of grace is thus helpt. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this clauſe of the Promiſe is made good in old Chriſtians, they are every day more and more rooted, firme, ſtable and judicious, and more able in thoſe graces which belong to their place and condition. Therefore, they ſhould not be diſcouraged, though they be not carried with the ſtreame and tide of nature, help'd with that vigour that ſometime was in them. They grow in judiciouſneſſe, mortifiedneſſe, in heavenly-mindedneſſe, and in ability to give good counſell to others. This is well, for we grow not in grace one way, but divers, waies; not onely when wee grow in outward demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and in many fruits and actions; but when wee grow in refinedneſſe and judiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (as was ſaid) then wee are ſaid to grow likewiſe.</p>

A young Chriſtian cannot be ſo plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſo deepely rooted as another that is of a greater ſtanding. This ſhould not diſcourage any, ſeeing there are babes in Chriſt, as well as ſtrong men. Therefore where there is truth of heart, with indeavour to grow better and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to uſe all meanes, let no man be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. Remember alway this for a truth, that we may grow, and we ought to grow, and the children of God ordinarily have growne more and more, both in fruitfullneſſe and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe every way, but not with a like growth in meaſure, or time. Therefore labour to make uſe of theſe Promiſes, and not to favour our ſelves in an ungrowing eſtate, for grace is of a growing nature. If it grow not in fruitfullneſſe, yet it growes in the Roote; as a plant ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times growes in fruitfullneſſe, ſometimes in the Roote. There is more vertue in Winter-time in the Roote, then in the fruit which is gone. So a Chriſtian groweth one way if not another: though not in outward demonſtration, yet in Humiliation. God ſometimes ſees it neceſſary, that our branches ſhould not ſpread for a while; but that we ſhould grow in Humility, by ſome faults and ſinnes we fall and ſlip into, that wee may ſee our own weakneſſe, and looke up.</p>
                     <p>Let us labour therefore who have ſo long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſuch ſtore of bleſſed meanes, under the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17937:145"/> dew of Gods grace and the influence of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the Paradice of God, his Houſe and Church, having ſo long lived in this <hi>Eden,</hi> let us labour now to ſpread, and grow in fruitfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that ſo we may be filled with the fullneſſe of God. It is the chiefe thing of all to be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and grow in grace. You ſee, God when he would ſingle out a bleſſing, he tells them not, that they ſhall grow rich, that they ſhall ſpread out and grow rich in the world. No, but you whom I love freely, take this as a fruit of it, <hi>You ſhall grow as the Lillie,</hi> you ſhall grow fruitfull <hi>as the Olive,</hi> &amp;c. This is the comfort of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, though he growes downeward oft in the world, and things of this naturall life, yet hee growes upward in another condition, as <hi>Lillies</hi> and <hi>Cedars,</hi> they grow downewards one way, but they grow upwards another. Perhaps they may decay in their ſtate and favour, and in their practiſe and cunning in this life: but a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, if he be in the uſe of right meanes, and put in ſuite the gratious Promiſes, he is ſure ſtill to grow in <hi>Grace,</hi> in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man.</p>
                     <p>Is not this a comfort, that a Chriſtian hath a comfortable meditation of the time to come in all his croſſes? That it is for better and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtill: that as in time he is neerer Heaven, ſo he ſhall be fitter and fitter, and neerer and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſtill with a diſpoſition ſuitable to the place. That the time to come is the beſt time, and that he ſhall grow every way, in height, in bredth,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17937:146"/> in depth and length,<note place="margin">SER. VIII.</note> and apprehenſion of Gods love: and that the more hee growes in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe things, the more hee ſhall grow in all dimenſions, being as ſure of things to come, as of things paſt: and that neither things preſent nor to come, ſhall ever ſeparate him from the love of God in Chriſt. What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſtate is a Chriſtian in, who is alwaies on the mending hand, that is ſuch a childe of hope, when the hope of the wicked ſhall periſh? Let us labour therefore, that we may be in ſuch a caſe and ſtate of ſoule, as that thoughts of the time to come may bee comfortable: that when wee thinke we muſt be traſplanted hence out of the Paradice and Eden of Gods Church, into a heavenly Paradice, that all our changes ſhall be for the better. What a fearefull thing is it to be in the ſtate of nature? What foundation hath a man in that eſtate, who hath no roote heere, and that roote he hath will faile him ere long? How fearefull is it for ſuch a man to thinke of a change, when it is not a change for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
                     <p>Here is wiſedome, if we will be wiſe to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, let us be wiſe this way, labour in the firſt place, to prize Gods favours, and to know how to come by them in the uſe of all meanes. Look to God for the performance of theſe gratious promiſes: for they are not of what we ſhall doe in our ſelves; but what God will do in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace. And if a Chriſtian ſhould not be rooted and grow ſtronger and ſtronger, wee
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17937:146"/> ſhould not faile,<note place="margin">SER. VII.</note> but God and Chriſt ſhould faile, who is our roote and beares us up. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath taken upon him the performance of all theſe things; what remaineth from us, but a carefull uſing of all meanes; and in the uſe of all, a going out of our ſelves to God, That hee would be <hi>as the Dew to us,</hi> and cauſe us by the dew of his Spirit to grow more and more roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in grace as long as we live in this world; and then our rooting and ſtability lies upon God, not upon us: he failes if we faile; who hath undertaken, That <hi>wee ſhall grow as the Lillie, and caſt foorth our Roots as Lebanon.</hi>

Which is fulfilled of the Church in generall, and of every particular Chriſtian, when once hee is in Chriſt, uſing ſanctified meanes: they grow then in the roote, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and in every dimenſion: <hi>His Branches ſhall ſpread,</hi> and then

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe excellencies promiſed to the Church of God, are not all in one tree, but yet they are in ſome ſort in every Chriſtian, what agrees not all to one plant, agrees to the <hi>plants of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe;</hi> they grow upwards and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſpread and are ſavoury and fruitfull: all agrees to a tree of righteouſneſſe. Wee ſay of man he is a little world, a compendium of this great world, as indeed there is a compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all the excellencies of the world in man; for he hath a being with thoſe creatures who have onely that, and therewith he hath grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſe and reaſon, whereby he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God and thoſe underſtanding Spirits the Angels: ſo that he is as it were a ſumme of all the excellencies of the creatures, a little world indeed. The great world hath nothing, but the little world hath the ſame in ſome proportion. So it is in Grace, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath all excellencies in him that are in the world: there is not an excellency in any thing but it is in an higher kinde in a Chriſtian. He hath the beauty of the <hi>Lillie,</hi> and he growes up in ſpreading, ſmell and fruitfulneſſe; his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome exceeds that of all the creatures: there is not an excellencie in nature, but wee have ſome proportionable excellencie in grace which is above it. God uſeth theſe outward things to helpe us, that we ſhould doe both body and ſoule good by the creatures. Whatſoever doth
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17937:150"/> our bodies good, either by neceſſity or delight, they helpe our ſoules: as plants and trees, not onely refreſh the outward man, and the ſenſes, but alſo they teach our ſoules, as heere the Holy Ghoſt teacheth them by outward things. Firſt it is faid

                     </p>
                     <p>When God enriches the ſoule with ſaving grace, one ſhall grow every way and flouriſh aboundantly, extending forth their goodneſſe one every ſide largely to the knowledge and open view of others, and then further,
<q>His Beauty ſhall be as the Olive tree.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is the beauty of the Olive tree? to be uſefull, fruitfull, and to bring forth good fruit. Indeed the glory of a tree is to be loaden with fruit, and uſefull fruit, which is the beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of fruit to be uſefull and delightfull. So the glory of a Chriſtian, who is a plant of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, of Gods own planting, is to abound in fruits of Righteouſneſſe. Indeed the Olive is a very fruitfull tree, and the oyle which comes and diſtils from it hath many excellent proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties agreeing to graces.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For we know <hi>Moyſture</hi> and <hi>Heate,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cauſes of the perpetuall flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of the Saints.</note> theſe two are the cauſes of all kindly growth. If a tree have more moyſture then heate, then it is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh, if it have more heate then moyſture, then there is no bigneſſe in the fruit. So true it is, that <hi>moiſture</hi> and <hi>heate</hi> are the cauſes of fruitfullneſſe, in a good proportion. So Gods children having the Sonne of Righteouſneſſe alwayes ſhining upon them, and being alwayes under the <hi>Dew</hi> of grace (the promiſe being, <hi>to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17937:151"/> be as the Dew to Iſrael</hi>) having all <hi>Dew</hi> to fall upon them for <hi>moyſture:</hi> and having the Sonne of Righteouſneſſe to ſhine upon them to make them fruitfull, their leafe never failes, they never give over bringing forth fruit: becauſe they have in them cauſes perpetuating fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though not alike. Becauſe Chriſt by his Spirit is a voluntary, and not a naturall cauſe of their fruitfulneſſe. That is, he is ſuch a cauſe as workes ſometimes more and ſometimes leſſe, to ſhew that grace ſprings not from our ſelves, and to acquaint us with our own weakenes and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency. Heaven is the perfection of all both Graces and Comforts.<note place="margin">1 Pet 1.4.</note> Wherfore <hi>Peter</hi> calls the ſtate of Heaven, <hi>an inheritance, immortall and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, that fades not away:</hi> Why is that an eſtate of grace and comfort more then this of this world? Becauſe it is a never fading eſtate, there they are alway in one tenure, and becauſe Chriſt ſhewes himſelfe alway there, there is aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of water to moyſten them, and heate to cheriſh them. There is no intermingling or ſtopping in growth as is here; therefore it is an inheritance that fadeth not away, having the ſupply of a perpetuall cauſe of flouriſhing.</p>
                     <p>This in ſome degree is true of the Church on earth, it is the inheritance of God that fades not, and Chriſtians therein are Olives that bring foorth fruit conſtantly, having a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall freſhneſſe and greenneſſe.<note place="margin">Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Therefore let us every one conſider with our ſelves, wherfore God hath ſet us in the Church in our particular ſtandings. Wherein let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, that howſoever God may endure barrenneſſe out of the Church in want of meanes; yet hee will never indure it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der meanes. It is better for a bramble to bee in the Wilderneſſe then in an Orchard; for a weed to bee abroad, then in a garden where it is ſure to be weeded out, as the other to bee cut downe. If a man will be unprofitable, let him bee unprofitable out of the Church: but to bee ſo where hee hath the dew of grace falling on him, in the meanes of ſalvation, where are all Gods ſweet favours; to bee a bramble in the Orchard, to bee a weed in the Garden, to be noyſome in a place where wee ſhould bee fruitfull, will God the great Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman indure this? He will not long put it up; but that hee exerciſeth his children with ſuch noyſome trees to trie them, as hee hath ſome ſervice for theſe thornes to doe, to ſcratch them: ſo were it not for ſuch like ſervices for a time, hee would weed them out and burne them, for whatſoever is not for fruit is for the fire:<note place="margin">Mat. 3.10.</note> 
                        <hi>Yea, every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, ſhall bee hewen downe and caſt into the fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the more to ſtirre us up hereunto, let us
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:17937:152"/> know that whereſoever the <hi>dew</hi> of grace falls, and where there is the meanes of ſalvation, that at that very time, there is an axe, an inſtrument of vengeance laid to the roote of the tree, which is not ſtruck downe preſently, but <hi>it is laid to the roote,</hi> that is vengeance is threatned to the tree, to that plant which hath the meanes, and brings not forth good fruit in time and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. What is the end thereof? to be hewen downe and caſt into the fire. As wee ſee the Church of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when Chriſt came, the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> the great Prophet of the Church, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there more meanes of ſalvation: yet even then, what ſaith <hi>Iohn Baptiſt, Now,</hi> even now, <hi>is the axe laid unto the roote of the tree;</hi> and indeed in a few yeares after, the whole tree, the Church of <hi>Iewes</hi> was cut downe. And <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. we ſee, after the Rider on the <hi>white horſe,</hi> which is the preaching of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> there comes a <hi>red bloodie Horſe,</hi> and a <hi>pale Horſe: Warre</hi> and <hi>Famine.</hi> After the <hi>white Horſe,</hi> his triumphant Chariot, the preaching of the Goſpell if this take not place, that it winne and gaine not: what followes after? the red and the pale Horſe, Warre, Famine, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. It will not be alway with us as it is; for the Goſpell having beene ſo long preached, we having beene ſo long planted in Gods Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice the Church: if we beare not fruit, <hi>The axe is laid to the roote of the tree:</hi> God will ſtrike at the roote, and roote up all, therfore let every one in their place bee fruitfull.</p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:17937:153"/>

O how contrary is this to the condition of many, what comes from them? filthy ſpeeches and oaths, nay that which ſhould be their ſhame they glory in. Wee ſee it is the glory of a tree to be fruitfull, and to caſt forth a good ſavour, like the trees of <hi>Lebanon.</hi> What vile ſpirits then are ſuch men led withall, who delight to offend God and man by their impious ſpeeches? who yet are ſo bold as to ſhew their faces, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare others that are better then themſelves: ſuch are contrary to all Gods ſenſes.

Now what a delightfull thing is it to have a reſting place with them, which either ſuffer no ill, or God turnes all ill to their great good? where God is a <hi>Sun</hi> and a <hi>ſhield,</hi> a <hi>Buckler,</hi> and an <hi>exceeding great reward,</hi> as he is to his Church and Children?</p>
                     <p>And then againe, God is about his Church, as a wall of fire to protect it,<note place="margin">Zach. 2.5.</note> not onely as a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to keepe of ſtormes, but as a wall of fire to keepe off and conſume enemies. God in regard of protection of his Church, is a compaſſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: as it is in <hi>Iob,</hi> ſaith Satan, <hi>Haſt thou not made a hedge about him and all that he hath?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob. 1.10.</note> There was a hedge about <hi>Iob,</hi> his wife, children and goods, which the Divell durſt not enter, nor make a gap in, untill God gave him leave.

                     <p>But this is eſpecially underſtood ſpiritually, the Church is a ſhadow, and her ſelfe under a ſhadow ſpiritually: that is, in regard of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all evills from the worſt enemies. For out of the Church, where is any fence for the greateſt ill of all, <hi>The wrath of God?</hi> Jn the Church of God there is ſet downe a way of pacification, how the wrath of God is taken of and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in reconciliation, by the death and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Jeſus Chriſt; whereby the beleeving ſoule attaineth peace and joy unſpeakable and glorious Out of the Church there is no meanes at all to pacifie the greateſt ill, therefore there is no true reſt out of the Church, nothing but ſtings and torments of conſcience. And as there is a ſhelter againſt the wrath of God, which burnes to the bottome of Hell: ſo here is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie againſt death and damnation: for now death is made a friend to the Church and the children of the Church, for the ſting of it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, ſo that it doth them more good then any thing in the world: ending all their miſery, and ſinning, and opening a paſſage unto eternall happineſſe. All other petty ills that attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on death are nothing: there is a reſt from all theſe whatſoever: for all afflictions have a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified uſe to Gods people for their good. There is therefore a reſt and refreſhing in the Church, for all thoſe that come under it.</p>
                     <p>And as this is true of the Church in generall, ſo it is true of particular families that are little Churches, there is reſt and happineſſe in them:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:17937:159"/> God bleſſeth all under the roofe of a godly man, whoſoever comes under that ſhadow comes for a bleſſing or for further hardning: we ſee in the current of Scripture ordinarily, that when God converted any one man, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his whole family,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.9.</note> 
                        <hi>Salvation is this day come to thy houſe,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) to <hi>Zaccheus;</hi> when ſalvation came to his heart, it came to his houſe,<note place="margin">Act. 16.33.</note> all was the better for it. So the <hi>Iaylor,</hi> when he beleeved, he and his whole houſe were Baptiſed: when God bleſſeth the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor once, then it is ſuppoſed all the houſe comes under the covenant of grace. <hi>Abraham</hi> and his houſe were bleſſed. But this holds not alwaies, for there was a <hi>Cham</hi> in good <hi>Noahs</hi> family, ſtill there will be Ravens and wilde beaſts, among the tame beaſts: there will be an <hi>Iſhmaell</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, a <hi>Doeg</hi> in the Church of <hi>Iuda,</hi> a <hi>Iudas</hi> in Chriſts family, and a <hi>Demas</hi> among Gods people. That is, let the family be never ſo good, you ſhall have ſome by Gods judgement naught in the ſame. As it is ſaid of <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> figs,<note place="margin">Ier. 24.1.</note> the good figs were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good, and the bad exceeding bad. There is none ſo good as thoſe that are in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious family, and none ſo nought, as ſuch who are naught there. Becauſe they are curſed and under a curſe being bad under ſuch gratious meanes: being like the ground which receives the raine and ſhowers from Heaven,<note place="margin">Heb. 6 7, 8.</note> and yet is not the better for it, and ſo is accurſed. If a man who is untoward were in a gratious family,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:17937:159"/> it is ſuppoſed he would be better, but thoſe who are naught where they ſhould be good, under abundance of meanes, ſuch are in danger to be ſealed to eternall deſtruction. Such being bad, are very bad, who though they breake not out to dangerous enormities, becauſe of the place; yet to have a barren untractable heart under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of meanes, is to be hardened to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, without a ſpeciall mercie to make it worke afterwards. For ſome who have lived in gratious families, though for the preſent the ſeed fructified not; yet have afterwards found that ſeed fructifie after a long time, and have bleſſed God that ever they came under ſuch a ſhadow: therefore though ſuch barrenneſſe be a dangerous ſigne, yet muſt we not ſuddenly either condemne our ſelves or others in this caſe. Becauſe in the things of God in the Church, it is as in nature, the ſeed ſprings not as ſoone as it is ſowen: ſo that grace at length which hath ſeem'd to lie dead, after many yeares may ſprout out. <hi>Monica</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> mother, was a gratious woman, whilſt hee was an untoward young man, as appeareth by his own confeſſions: yet his mother having prayed much for him, he was converted after her death and became a glorious Father and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the Churches good. Jt is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry amongſt us, many when they have gone aſtray, reflect home upon themſelves, conſider under what meanes they have beene, calling to minde the gratious inſtructions they have
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:17937:160"/> had, and ſo by Gods aſſiſtance are new men. Therefore let none deſpaire, in regard of time or place; becauſe God may have further aimes then we can reach too; but unleſſe God give a ſpeciall bleſſing after ſuch watering, it is for the increaſe of condemnation, not to profit under ſuch abounding meanes, but ſtill to be like <hi>Pharoahs</hi> leane kine,<note place="margin">Gen 41.</note> full fed and leane ſtill. For the Promiſe is: <hi>Thoſe that are under his ſhadow ſhall returne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is here a fit occaſion offered to ſpend much time in preſſing care upon thoſe that are Governours, that even out of love unto thoſe that are under them, they would labour to bee gratious: becauſe if they be gratious, God will give them thoſe that are in their family. The whole family was baptiſed when the Maſter was baptiſed, and when any man was called, the whole family came within the covenant. When <hi>Shechem</hi> and <hi>Hamor</hi> were circumciſed,<note place="margin">Gen 34.24.</note> all the cittie was circumciſed alſo. Jt is true eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of Governours, there is no man that hath grace for himſelfe alone: God gives ſpeciall graces to ſpeciall perſons to be a meanes to draw on many others. Whereſoever grace is, it is of a ſpreading nature: it is ſaid here of ſuch, their <hi>Branches ſhall ſpread:</hi> It is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative, and of a piercing nature, a little wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will worke ſtrangely.<note place="margin">2 King. 5.3.</note> As we know a little ſhort ſpeech of a poore maid to <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi> how it wrought, and was the occaſion of his converſion.

Nay further, not onely
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:17937:161"/> the Governour of the family, but if there be any gratiouſly good in the family, they doe much good. <hi>Labans</hi> family was the better for <hi>Iacob:</hi>

It is a true poſition, God ſtabliſheth grace in none who are gratious, for themſelves meerely, but for the good of others alſo that converſe with them: whether it bee Governours or ſervants: no man liveth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and for himſelfe onely; but for the good of all within their reach.</p>

But haſt thou no care of thy children, of thy wife that lieth in thy boſome, or of thy ſervants? if thou haſt not a heart of ſtone or marble, ſurely thou wouldeſt deſire that for them, that thou doſt not for thy ſelfe: thinke of this, at leaſt thou wouldeſt have thy children good and proſper. Labour then if we would have all proſper who come under our roofe, that our families may be little Churches of God, that all who come under our ſhadow may revive and returne.

So it is with a Chriſtian, when he is planted he will leaven others, and thoſe others and others. A few Apoſtles leavened the whole world, ſcattering the Goſpell like lightning all over the ſame.

                        <note place="margin">Cant. 1.3.</note> that is, himſelfe is his Name, and his Name is himſelfe
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:17937:171"/> (as the Hebrew Proverbe is) Chriſt made knowne in the unfolding of the Word, that is his Name. When the box is opened, all in Chriſt is like oyntment, in the preaching of the Word all is ſweet, and nothing but ſweet in Jeſus. Now a Chriſtian being a member of Chriſt, and a virgin ſoule following Chriſt, muſt needs draw ſweetneſſe from him, caſting out that ſent unto others drawen from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they partake of Chriſts annoynting. What is the name of a Chriſtian, but a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with Chriſts oyntment, one annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a King and a Prieſt in ſome ſort?<note place="margin">Rev. 1.6.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they carry the ſavour of him whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they goe. <hi>Aaron</hi> the high Prieſt,<note place="margin">Exo. 39.26.</note> had ſweet garments, which made a ſavour where he went, having Bels and ſweet Pomgranates at the bottome of his garment. Hee had not onely Bels to diſcover him; but ſweet pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates alſo. So it is with every Chriſtian; not onely the Miniſter, but every Chriſtian is a Prieſt under the New Teſtament, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a ſavour with him, graces that ſpread and caſt a ſweet ſent in all places whereſoever, which they exerciſe upon all good occaſions: as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.5.</note> 
                        <hi>They ſavour the things of the Spirit.</hi> Thoſe who are in Chriſt, they have the Spirit of Chriſt, or they are none of his. And having the Spirit of Chriſt they ſavour of the things of the Spirit, that is their thoughts, ſpeeches, actions, and converſation are ſavoury.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.8.</note> Thoſe <hi>that are in the fleſh</hi> (ſaith the)
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:17937:172"/> Apoſtle <hi>cannot pleaſe God,</hi> they are unſavoury. A carnall man hath no ſavour in his ſpeeches, they are either worldly or civill, without ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſavour: becauſe he hath nothing of the Spirit of Chriſt to ſavour off. His heart (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi>) is little worth,<note place="margin">Pro. 10 20.</note> the like we may ſay of his thoughts, actions, and affections, they are unſavoury and little worth. Hee hath a dead heart to goodneſſe, and thence whatſoever goodneſſe commeth from him is forced and againſt the haire (as we ſay) But a Chriſtian having the Spirit of Chriſt; and therewith communion with Chriſt, all his diſcourſes and actions are for the moſt part ſavoury, thoſe he acteth as a Chriſtian; therefore from his communion with Chriſt it is ſaid here, <hi>His ſmell ſhall be as Lebanon.</hi>

As it is with heate that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth fire alway; ſo there is a kinde of heate of comfort, which naturally accompanieth the heate of any good action: there remaineth a ſweet reliſh to the conſcience of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, reflecting with Humility upon himſelfe, with thankefulneſſe to God, from whoſe <hi>Dew</hi>

                     <p>Now who would not be in ſuch an eſtate and condition as this; as to have title to all theſe gratious promiſes, for the <hi>dew</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> to fall upon him, <hi>To grow as Lillies</hi> in height, and to ſpread as other plants doe, to grow upwards, and downewards, to be <hi>rooted</hi> as <hi>Cedars,</hi> and <hi>fruitfull</hi> as <hi>Vines.</hi> The Spirit of God ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe here to ſhew Spirituall things by Earthly compariſons, to make us the more capable of them. The miſery of the contrary condition may well ſtirre us up to ſeeke after the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. For what a miſery is it, to have the curſe of God upon ones ſoule, to have it like the barren wilderneſſe void of all grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that may delight others, or is ſpirituall, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, or ſavingly good?

                     <p>Thus by Gods bleſſing we have paſſed over the particulars of Gods gratious promiſes to his Church, and all that ſhall come under the Church; all which ſhould incourage us to goe to God, and doe as the Church doth here, <hi>take words to our ſelves,</hi> and deſire God, <hi>to take away all iniquity, and heale all our backeſlidings,</hi> and that we may renounce all vaine confidence, as the Church doth here: who is taught to truſt

Therefore let us have in the eye of our ſoule the excellency of growth; or elſe we ſhall not value theſe promiſes. Let us conſider what an excellent condition it is to grow, flouriſh and be fruitfull, having a due eſteeme of all theſe promiſes before hand.<note place="margin">The excellency of a growing Chriſtian <hi>Prov. 28.1.</hi>
                        </note> Doe but conſider how excellent a Chriſtian is that groweth above others, what a majeſty he hath in his carriage? how undauntedly he walks in all oppoſitions whatſoever, as a <hi>Lyon</hi> in his courſes.

He carrieth his Heaven in his heart, and a Paradice within him, which is planted with all graces, whereas another man carrieth his Hell about him.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore let us take ſuch courſes to helpe our ſelves as the Church doth here: truſt in God and not in man, or in the arme of fleſh; and be incouraged from all which hath beene ſaid, to have a good conceit of God, to bee fruitfull and draw on others to goodneſſe, that God, his Saints and Angells may be delighted with the ſent of our graces, and our ſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; that we may rejoyce in our portion and lot that God hath dealt ſo gratiouſly to us, and glory more that he has made us members of

Therefore we muſt value our ſelves and things, as we are in our will and affections: for ſo God valueth us, and we ſhould value others thereby.

The diſcoverie of hatred to the faults either in a Miniſter, or in a Megiſtrate, though they muſt be truely dealt with, and have their faults told them: yet there muſt be reſpect had to their place, by reaſon of the weakeneſſe of men.

Yet theſe muſt be cut off,<note place="margin">Col. 3.2.</note> mortified, crucified, and denyed. Therefore let us not deceive our ſelves: but let us judge of the truth of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, by our true hatred to ſinne in our ſelves and others, and in all who are committed to our charge.</p>
                     <p>If this be ſo, what ſhall we judge of a cold luke-warme temper? It is the nature of cold to gather Heterogeniall bodies together. As we ſee in Ice there are ſtrawes, and ſtones and all Heterogeniall things incorporated, becauſe the cold congeales them together. But where there is fire, there is a ſeperating of the droſſe from the good mettall. So where the Spirit of God is, it is not ſo cold as to jumble ſin and ſin, this and that together: but it purgeth away that which is ill, and that which is good it makes better. For in what proportion the fire of Gods Spirit ſtirs up that which is good, in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion

Thus <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he had talked with God in the mountaine, at his returne ſeeing them dancing and ſacrificing to the Calfe of gold, what did <hi>Moſes?</hi> he brake the Tables aſunder. So it is with thoſe that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, who is light it ſelfe,<note place="margin">1 Iohn. 1.5.</note> and in whom is no darkeneſſe, who is Holineſſe and Puritie it ſelfe: thoſe who have effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſed with God in his Ordinances, Meditation, Prayer and the like; when they looke upon ſinne which is contrary to God, they looke upon it with a more perfect hatred.

I ſhould love God above all and my brother as my ſelfe; and hate the Divell and all his workes, whom J have renounced in my Baptiſme; therefore in diſtempers of the affections, make a diverſion, and turne them the right way. As Phyſitians uſe to doe, when the diſtempered blood runs dangerouſly one way, If they cannot ſtop that, they open a veine to drive the courſe of the blood another way. So it is Chriſtian pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, when the affections run dangerouſly one way, then to reflect thus upon our ſelves. I but is this the end why God hath placed this affection in me, Certainely no, he hath planted this affection in me for another purpoſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I will hate that which I ſhould hate, ſinne
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:17937:189"/> in generall: and my owne ſinne moſt of all, which makes me hate my brother. This ſhould be our daily taske and ſtudy, to take off the affections where they ſhould not be placed, and to fix them where they ſhould be placed: and there to let them goe amaine, the faſter the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; reſtraining them where they ſhould not runne out.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ought to temper our ſelves, and to worke in our ſelves as much as may be a ſound hatred to all ſinne, not onely of the ſecond Table, but of the firſt alſo.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God hath framed the ſoule that it may injoy the cheefe good, and avoid the cheefe ill eſpecially, for pettie goods and pettie ils are not ſo behoovefull: Yet notwithſtanding God will have us avoid all ill, and imbrace all good, and he hath made the ſoule into an anſwerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Therefore hath hee planted affections therein tending to good; as Love, and Joy and delight, eſpecially made for the imbracing of the maine good, thereby to goe out of it ſelfe, and cloſe with that maine cheefe good, in clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing wherewith it may be happy.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And then to avoid the cheefe ill, ſinne and damnation, hee hath planted affections of averſation, abhorring, hatred, griefe and the like. Thus hath he framed the ſoule for theſe maine ends, without which affections, the ſoule were as <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> that dead ſea. The
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:17937:211"/> affections are the wings and the winde of the ſoule, that carrie it unto all which it is carried unto: eſpecially when the winde of Gods Spirit blowes upon it, then it is carried out of it ſelfe, for of it ſelfe it cannot love or hate as it ſhould, but God muſt raiſe the affections, and lay them downe againe. Wee have not the managing of our owne hearts; grace teacheth us to doe all.</p>
                     <p>The particular then here, is indignation and hatred, <hi>What have I now any more to doe with Idols?</hi> So that the proper affection in Gods children, which ſhould be converſant about that which is ill, and ſinnefully ill, is hatred and indignation, here is hatred with indignation, the extent of the affection.</p>

So in the ſoule of a Chriſtian ſo farre as grace is renewed, there is an antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, averſation and abhorring of that which is
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:17937:212"/> contrary. What have I to doe with ſinne in any kinde? when grace hath altered the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a mans heart, then ſinne and he are two: two indeed in the moſt oppoſite tearmes that may be, what have I any more to doe with my former delightfull ſinnes? we are two now, for we were before nothing but ſinne.

For let us conſider that it is not onely ill in it ſelfe, defiling the ſoule, and hindering communion with God, but it is alſo the cauſe of all ills, being the ill of ills, as God is the good of goods.

If we had an enemy, eſpecially if he were a ſoothing falſe enemie, that under pretence of love ſhould ſeeke our bane and ruine, and joyne with our worſt enemies, would we not hate ſuch an enemy? Sinne is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemy which we have in the world, and doth us more harme then the Divell himſelfe, for it betrayeth us to the Divell, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of favouring and pleaſing our nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes us. It is a falſe deceitfull enemy, which commeth not in an ugly ſhape, but cloſes with the ſoule in a kinde of conjugall love, <hi>Dalilah</hi> like inticing and alluring us, whereby it hath the more advantage and ſtrength, in that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in a lovely, pleaſing, and not in an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious commanding manner: therfore it ſhould be the more hatefull to us. Shall we not hate ſuch an enemy as alwayes dogs us, and hinders us, hinders us from doing any thing well, and puts us on to all that is ill. It is ſuch an enemy that we cannot goe about to pray or doe any good thing but it hangs upon us and clogs us in all our performances.

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:17937:213"/> and then ſhould he cheriſh that which makes a breach betwixt him and his beſt friend? If a man ſaw one ſo maliciouſly evill towards him, as to ſow diſſention by all meanes hee could betwixt him and his beſt honourable friend by vvhom hee vvas maintained in all things, vvould not a man hate ſuch a one? vvhat doth ſinne elſe but breed diviſion and emnity betvvixt God and us? and further, vvhen it hath mooved us to doe ill, it cryeth for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt us at Gods hands. Conſcience ſoundly avvakened, is alvvayes clamarous to pull ſomevvhat from God againſt us. Are not ſinners juſtly called fooles? either men muſt be Atheiſts to deny all, or elſe if they cheriſh ſinne, they muſt needs be fooles and ſtarke mad if they confeſſe this that they joyne vvith that vvhich is their chiefe enemy. Therefore learne to be vviſe to ſalvation, make not vvith <hi>Salomons</hi> foole a ſport of ſinne,<note place="margin">Pro. 10.23.</note> of ſvvearing of defiling our ſelves and others, ſeeing God threatneth damnation unto ſuch.</p>
                     <p>And then againe, avoide all parly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with ſinne in the firſt ſuggeſtions; or with wicked perſons that may draw us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

Therefore uſe it hardly in the firſt beginnings, and avoid Satan in the firſt
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:17937:213"/> ſuggeſtions, if we love the peace of our ſoules, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> here, <hi>what have I any more to doe with Idols?</hi> for as we ſay in the caſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. They come to neare that come to have the refuſall. They ſhould not have ſo much hope from a chaſt perſon, there ſhould be ſuch a modeſt carriage, as ſhould not give any one the boldneſſe to adventure in that kind. So if a man carry himſelfe remotely from ſinnfull courſes, he ſhall have a great deale of peace from wicked men, who dare not ſo much as adventure to draw away ſuch a one, they know he is reſolved. Therefore conſtant reſolution againſt all ſinne and wicked men will breed a great deale of peace, ſo as to ſay with <hi>Ephraim, what have I any more to doe with Idols?</hi>

                        <hi>and all other things ſhall be miniſtred unto you.</hi> The Truth of God and then his Mercy makes this good. Is not God mercifull to his children when they renounce all falſe confidence? Jn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the truth of his promiſe and mercy, he will make good this, that nothing is loſt by cleaving to him. We reade in the ſtory of our owne times, in King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixts raigne, the ſame day that there was reformation of Idolatry in <hi>London,</hi> purging of Churches from roodes and Idols. The ſame day was that noble victorie and conqueſt in the North parts over the enemies. So God anſwered their care in reforming things amiſſe with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, when we goe on with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring abuſes and corruptions, yet expecting good ſucceſſe, it is in vaine. Let <hi>Ephraim</hi> come to ſay, <hi>What have I to doe with Idols?</hi> and ſee then whether God will reſpect him or not. Doe Nations or perſons thinke that God will reſpect them or bleſſe them, whilſt they doe that which is abhominable to him.

                     <p>It is never better with a Chriſtian, then when he hath renounced all wicked courſes, though he thinkes himſelfe undone if he leave his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Dalilah</hi> delights, but there is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for we ſhall finde a hundred fold more in God,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.29:</note> as Chriſt ſpeakes, <hi>Whoſoever leaves father or mother, brother or ſiſter, houſe or kindred for me, ſhall have a hundred fold in this world,</hi> that is, they ſhall have it in contentment and grace, in peace of conſcience, and perhaps in the things of this life in another kinde. What loſt <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> when he obeyed God, and forſooke his fathers houſe? God was all-ſufficient for him, he grew a rich man.

There is nothing loſt by depending and waiting upon God, and renouncing of carnall confidence. We think naturally we are undone, O! there is no ſuch matter, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>When my father and mother forſaketh me,</hi>

                     <q>I have obſerved him.</q>
                     <p>That is, I will have a ſpeciall eye to him, I will looke to him in all conditions and ſtates whatſoever: God never ſlumbers nor ſleepes, like the Maſter of the houſe in the Parable,<note place="margin">Luk. 11.5.</note> who when the poore man came for bread, all the reſt being aſleepe is awake, and raiſed up by the importunity of the poore man. So the great Maſter of the family of Heaven and Earth that governes all, hee wakes day and night and never ſleepes; herein going beyond the care of the deareſt friends we have in the world, for they muſt have a time to ſleepe, the mother though ſhe love the childe as her owne bowells, yet notwithſtanding ſhee muſt have a reſting time, and perhaps in that time the childe may miſcarry: but God alwayes obſerves, his eye is alwayes upon his children, they are before him, written in the palmes of his hands;<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.16.</note> he hath them in his eye: as in <hi>Exodus,</hi> you have there God brought in obſerving the children of <hi>Iſraell: I have ſeene,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exo. 3.7.</note> 
                        <hi>I have ſeene the affliction of my people Iſraell;</hi> they thought themſelves neglected of God, but he tells <hi>Moſes, I have ſeene, I have ſeene,</hi> I know it very well, hee adds
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:17937:218"/> knowledge to ſight. So there is no affliction in this world to Gods children, but God in ſeeing ſees, as before he heares the groanes and ſighs, ſo he ſees the moſt intimate inward affliction whatſoever that afflicts the ſoule, as they were grieved in very ſoule at the tyranny of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> Oh but God in ſeeing hee ſees, whoſe eyes are ten thouſand times brighter then the Sunne. This is a conſolation, when one thinks that no man ſees and regards alas, what ſhall become of me? Why ſhould any man ſay ſo that hath God to go too, who is all eye, and all eare. God heares and ſees, his eares are alwayes open, as it is often ſhewed, eſpecially <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.15.

                     <p>God is not onely to his children a <hi>Firre tree</hi> in regard of ſhadow, that tree abounding in leaves very thicke, whereby we are kept from annoyance of ſcorching heats of troubles and terrors of conſcience, and perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is not all, but he ſaith alſo, <q>From mee is thy fruit found.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Firre tree</hi> though it be for thickneſſe of the leaves a very good ſhade, yet it is a barren fruitleſſe tree, but God is ſuch a tree as hath both ſhadow and fruit, in God there is a ſupply of all wants whatſoever. All the ſcattered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of all creatures being united in God, and eminent in him, it is in him, and in him in a divine gratious eminent and comfortable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. All the creatures as they come from God, are his creatures, neither is there any creature but hath ſomewhat of God in it. Therefore God vouchſafes to take Names from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be a Rocke of ſalvation, he is as a
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:17937:227"/> rocke to build on, to be a ſhadowing tree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a defence from ill, and to be a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tree, becauſe he yeelds good and comfort and grace as he doth fruit. When we ſee any thing that is uſefull, we may ſay this we have from God in an eminent manner, this preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and comfort. Doe J in my paſſage to Heaven finde ſuch comfort in the creature? when I am paſſing through a wilde place, have I ſuch comfort in the ſhadow of a tree? or when I am hungry am I ſo refreſhed by a fruitfull tree? what comfort then is there in God, in Heaven, in glory, when there are ſuch comforts in the way of my pilgrimage in this world, therefore God is ſaid here both to be a <hi>firee tree,</hi> and a fruitfull tree. For then the paſſenger travelling through a wild barren place, thinkes himſelfe made, when he can retire from the ſcorching of the heat, and alſo therewithall find fruitfullneſſe; ſhade and fruit concurring, hee thinkes himſelfe marvellouſly happy. This is the ſtate of a Chriſtian that hath God for his God, being in covenant with him, he is not onely a ſtrong protection and defence from all annoyance (as God ſhadowes us and is a Buckler from all evills both inward and outward, from Sathan and all kindes of evills and wrath) but he is alſo a fruitfull tree too, <hi>From mee is thy fruit found.</hi>

If a paſſenger in diſtreſſe have not onely a <hi>firre tree</hi> to ſhelter him and ſhadow him, but a fruit tree alſo to feed him, he thinkes he is made, when God thus comforts him. So a Chriſtian he hath not onely ſhelter from the wrath of God; but hee hath alſo a place of reſt and quiet, the mercy of God to keepe him, and the Word and Sacraments to feed him.

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:17937:232"/> yeeld is from God. So that now this is a grand difference, <hi>Adam</hi> as it were had the keeping of his owne happineſſe locked up in himſelfe, but we have our happineſſe, graces, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is good for us ſhut up in Chriſt, as the Spring and Fountaine, which is the reaſon of the perpetuall ſtability and permanent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods children, once his and ever his. And put the caſe we want this or that helpe, yet this prejudiceth not the perpetuity of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Gods children, becauſe thoſe graces which come immediately from Gods Spirit, may be conveyed ſometimes without meanes, as well as with them. Therefore whatſoever decay is in the branches that are grafted into this noble Vine Chriſt Jeſus, in whom we bare all the fruit we beare; yet notwithſtanding there is life everlaſting for us in the roote, which is by little and little diſtilled into us. The leaves may fall, outward things may decay, but there is life alway in the roote of a Chriſtian, becauſe he is in Chriſt, and hath his fruit from him: he cannot want fruit, no more then Chriſt can want influence and vigor.<note place="margin">Iohn. 15.5.</note> Which ſhewes us the excellent ſtate of a Chriſtian under the new Covenant of grace, that now we fetch all out of our ſelves, and it is happy for us that we doe ſo. For without Chriſt wee can doe nothing, as without the ſoule the body can doe nothing, ſo without the Spirit of Chriſt, we can doe nothing, from him is all. This is the reaſon why we muſt not truſt to any grace in our ſelves
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:17937:233"/> that comes from us, becauſe grace comes from God in Chriſt, truſt God the Spring whence it comes, whoſe the fruit is, God the Father in Chriſt, from whom all fulneſſe comes, and is derived unto us: or elſe wee make but an Idoll of grace, if we truſt too much to grace, looke to the Spring whence all comes to us: <hi>From me is thy fruit found.</hi>

Yet notwithſtanding there is a liberty in the Spirit of Chriſt, to give a more or leſſe meaſure of grace, to ſhew that our good we doe ſprings not from our ſelves. Which alſo is the reaſon of the difference betwixt Chriſtians, becauſe God will ſhew that he is the diſpoſer and the diſpencer of his owne graces, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.

So that this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cleaving and uniting of our ſoules to Chriſt, it comes from this that I have all from him, therefore I muſt cleave to him, ſeeing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſpirituall, holy, and comfortable I muſt have from him. Therefore if we would wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in Spirit and Truth, as we ſhould doe, and ſet him up in his due place in the ſoule, let us labour to have our judgements ſanctified in this, that all comes from God. If we were ſurely grounded in the Goodneſſe, Mercy, and Riches of Gods grace, and knew that all our fruit comes and is from him, this would make us to conclude, that therefore it is reaſon that we ſhould worſhip him and depend upon him ſtrictly. As the Prophet ſpeakes of Idols,<note place="margin">Ier. 10.5.</note> that they can neither doe us good nor harme, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that they ſhould not feare them, ſo wee may ſay of all other things diſtinct from God, they can neither doe good nor harme, except God inable them. Will you be ſlaves to men, they cannot doe good nor harme, but as God

We thinke if ſuch friends and helps be taken away, that then all is gone, but what were they? were not they meanes which God used at his good pleaſure, and cannot hee give comfort without them? yes certainely, the greateſt comfort and grace is oft-times given immediately from God, when he ſalutes the ſoule by his owne Spirit, as he did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> in the dungeon, who in the midſt of diſcomfort,<note place="margin">Act. 16.25.</note> had their ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged to ſing hymnes at mid-night: God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that comfort for that time.

No, <hi>From me is thy fruit found.</hi> If they could take away the Spirit of God, grace and comfort from us it were ſomething, but can they doe that? no, the worſt they can doe, is to ſend us to Heaven to the Fountaine of all grace and comfort: ſo that in this world they cannot caſt us into any condition wherein
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:17937:236"/> wee cannot have communion with God, in whom all the ſcattered excellencies of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are gathered together meeting as it were in a center. It is hee that comforts us in our friends, that ſhewes bowels to us in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wiſdome and care towards us in our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. The bowels of a mother, the care of a friend, the ſtrength of wiſe aſſiſtance, hath hee not all in himſelfe, if all be taken away? he hath all. Therefore let Chriſtians comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they can never be in a condition wherein fruit ſhall be taken from them. The poore worldling labours all his life for fruite, riches and friends, and when he dyes then his fruit faileth him and fals, his leafe withereth. What becommeth of his fruit then? he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that which yeelds him nothing but vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and death. But a Chriſtian doth otherwiſe, he labours for grace and comfort, to keepe his communion and peace with God, and when all is taken away, either by the injury and wrongs of men, or by the extreamity of the times, or as all will in the houre of death: his fruit is moſt after, in death and after death, more then can be by our narrow hearts conceived in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency thereof. O the excellent eſtate of a Chriſtian! imagine ſuch a one to have a tree that growes in Heaven, and ſends forth fruit and branches to him in whatſoever ſtate he is in. And ſo indeed God reacheth fruit from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the ſoule being in priſon and miſery. He reacheth from thence the fruit of grace, of
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:17937:237"/> ſpirituall ſtrength and comfort, a bleſſed eſtate. Therefore let Chriſtians comfort themſelves in their condition, <hi>that all their fruit is from him:</hi> and that God eſpecially will then ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboundant, when they ſtand moſt in need of him. Other trees beare no fruit in winter and in ſtormes, but God giveth fruit moſt in the worſt times. He is a God that comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the abject.

                     <p>Therefore by theſe mercies of God here mentioned,<note place="margin">Exhortation.</note> let us be intreated to be in love with the condition of a Chriſtian life; and ſay as <hi>Ephraim</hi> here, what have I any more to doe with my former corrupt courſes, or Idols? give a peremptory anſwer to all ſinnefull courſes and

<pb n="422" facs="tcp:17937:240"/> the <hi>Calves,</hi> the Princes remooved the bounds, (old orders and lawes) the Prophets they were fooles and did not ſee the judgements of God hanging over their heads; and none of them all could ſee their <hi>gray-haires,</hi> that is, the ſignes of their owne ruine. After which out of a Chriſtian love, care, and conſcience of his duty, by direction of the Spirit of God, hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes an excellent way how they ſhould carry themſelves, by returning to the Lord, <hi>take words unto your ſelves,</hi> renounce all falſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in <hi>Aſhur,</hi> and all domeſticke helps at home, horſes and the like, and flye to God as your beſt Sanctuarie. Then hee ſhewes what God will doe to them, anſwer all the deſires he had put into their hearts: <hi>I will heale their Backeſlidings and love them freely,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe theſe were great matters of great conſequence, to make them either happy in the obſerving them, or miſerable in neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, you ſee how he ſhuts up all in a moſt weighty cloſe: <hi>Who is wiſe and he ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe things, prudent and he ſhall know them, for the wayes of the Lord are equall,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Wherein the ſcope of the Prophet is, to ſtirre up a holy regard of what hath beene ſpoken, he would not have all loſt for want of attention or application, and therefore he here ſtirs them up to a holy uſe of all: which ſtirring up, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently and figuratively cloathed with an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphonemy,</hi> or acclamation, <hi>who is wiſe and he ſhall underſtand theſe things,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:17937:240"/> ſay, let men underſtand theſe things, but <hi>who is wiſe and who is prudent?</hi> Let them conſider of theſe things, and then the <hi>Exhortation</hi> is back't with many Reaſons,

And they leade to happineſſe directly, without winding and turning, a man is ſure to attaine his journeys end in them, and if they will take example of thoſe who onely are exemplary to them, he tels them <hi>the Iuſt ſhall walke in them,</hi> they ſhall not walke alone, they ſhall have the company of <hi>a cloud of witneſſes,</hi> who proſper and walke on cheerefully in this way, and attaine hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in the end.</item>
                           <item>4.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now theſe are ſtrong and forcible reaſons to inforce care and attention of what hath been ſpoken, it is <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> and <hi>the wayes of the Lord</hi> here <hi>are ſtreight,</hi> and then <hi>all godly people walke in them, and thoſe that ſtumble at them are ſure to periſh, and doe periſh in them;</hi> not that they are a cauſe of their periſhing, but by reaſon of the malice of men, finding fault and picking quarrels with them, they fall firſt into ſinne, and then into miſery, thus we have the ſcope of the words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Who is wiſe and he ſhall underſtand theſe things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, we muſt know that the Prophet here in this figurative ſpeech makes a kinde of Exclamation, <hi>who is wiſe?</hi> he doth as it were ſecretly mourne at the Apoſtacy and fewneſſe of thoſe that be truely wiſe, as if he had ſaid, I have given you many directions, and ſhewed you what ſinnes lead to deſtruction, I have ſhewed what courſe yee are to take, and the bountie of God to thoſe that Returne: but, <hi>Who is Wiſe and Prudent to regard theſe things?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Jn the words therefore (in regard of the ſpeaker, the Prophet) we may obſerve this ere we come particularly to them: the character of a holy, mercifull, gratious, and wiſeman, that when he hath ſpoken things to excellent purpoſe, he would not have thoſe things loſt, but out of mercy and compaſſion mingled with
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:17937:241"/> a great deale of heavenly wiſdome, would have the beſt fruit of all he hath ſpoken. Which was the cuſtome of the men of God in the Scriptures, the Spirit of God leading them to ſtrike the naile home, when they taught truths to lay the word cloſe upon the conſcience, as much as they could. What is the whole book of <hi>Deutrenomie,</hi> as the word ſignifieth, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating of the former lawes? <hi>Moſes</hi> thought all to no purpoſe, unleſſe he repeated lawes, and faſtned them upon the ſoule: ſo our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt ſtill when he had ſpoken excellent things, ſaith, <hi>Let him that hath eares to heare, heare.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 11.15. Iere. 9.12.</note> 
                        <hi>who is wiſe to conſider theſe things?</hi> and the concluſion of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent 107. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> is juſt thus, <hi>who is wiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things?</hi> and <hi>Deuter.</hi> 32. ſaith <hi>Moſes, O that they were wiſe, that they would thinke of theſe things,</hi> &amp;c. So every wherein Scripture you have ſuch faſtning of things where truthes have beene ſpoken in application of them: which doth juſtifie the courſe of Gods Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in bringing the Word home unto mens conſciences, becauſe that which is ſpoken looſely in generall, no man applyeth in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to himſelfe, we who are meſſengers of God, muſt therefore bring things home to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: <hi>who is wiſe and he ſhall underſtand theſe things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Yea it is the ſtate of all men, eſpecially thoſe that are puft up, either by their owne place, humour, or the flattery of others, they will have their will: <hi>Mens mihi pro Regno,</hi> as one ſaid. Now this being the proud poyſonfull nature of man, we muſt not thinke it a ſtrange thing, that there are ſo few wiſe and prudent: for a man cannot be wiſe and paſſionate, for his paſſion transformes him to be a beaſt, a Divell. Now becauſe moſt men live by ſenſe and by humour, which is a life they are nuzled in (eſpecially thoſe that
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:17937:242"/> are ſubject to flatterers) therefore few come to be truely wiſe and prudent, to have ſo much ſtedineſſe and ſobriety of ſpirit, as to deliberate what is to be done. They will not in cold blood give leiſure to their humors (but feed them) to conſider what is beſt. This being the humor of the world, no wonder that there be ſo few prudent and wiſe.</p>

A proud man till he be ſubdued and humbled, had rather be thought diſhoneſt then ſimple, becauſe if hee be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt, he thinkes it is out of choice: but to be ſimple, this argueth imperfection, and not

                     <p>Man at firſt when he had communion with wiſedome it ſelfe was a wiſe creature, till he hearkened to Sathan and ſo loſt all, <hi>becomming as the beaſts which periſh.</hi>

Prudence is an application of the generall knowledge of generall things to particulars, and is an ordering of the life in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exigencies and caſes in a right order, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the direction of the Spirit, as wee have it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. <hi>I wiſdome dwell with prudence.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>wiſedome</hi> whereſoever it is dwells with <hi>prudence;</hi> that is, where God doth inlighten the underſtanding to conceive aright of the miſteries of ſalvation, there it dwells with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that is, it directs the ſoule to an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carriage of life towards God and man, and in regard of it ſelfe, every way as it ſhould doe, in all eſtates, times and conditions, that is meant here by <hi>prudence,</hi> a particular gift where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man is fit to conſult and deliberate of things in particular to be done, in particular caſes of conſcience and the like. Now <hi>wiſedome</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi> they are both together in Gods people, howſoever perhaps one is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then another. Some are wiſer who have a deeper ſearch of truths in generall: and ſome are more prudent in their wayes, that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Chriſtians for the maine generall truths. Yet there is not a good Chriſtian but he hath ſo much <hi>prudence</hi> as will bring him to Heaven. But God giveth extraordinary wiſedome to ſome, becauſe they are leaders of others. Yet though in Gods diſpenſation there be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:17937:244"/> yet in every Chriſtian they are joyned together, there is no Chriſtian but hee is wiſe for himſelfe, which is <hi>Prudence.</hi> This is as it were the ſalt which ſeaſoneth all other graces, and knowledge whatſoever: for what is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without diſcretion, but a fooliſh hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? what is Patience but blockiſhneſſe, if a man doe not diſcerne how, why and upon what ground to be patient? what is Religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without this, but ſuperſtition, and what is Zeale but an indiſcreet heate, if it be not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with this Prudence? yea and what is Conſtancy it ſelfe, but an indiſcreet rigour and ſtifneſſe without wit. So that it is the ſeaſoning of all other graces whatſoever, that which puts bounds and meaſure unto all: therefore hee joynes it with Wiſdome, <hi>who is wiſe and who is prudent?</hi> good as we ſay conſiſts of a whole entire cauſe, unto which muſt be occurrence of all circumſtances together, one defect may make it to be ſinnefull. So this is <hi>Prudence</hi> to obſerve a due order cloathed with circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the manner and ſeaſon of every good action and duty, therefore be joynes heere <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

There muſt bee firſt a ſpirituall <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> inlightned by the Spirit, ere we can make uſe of the word aright to taſte and reliſh it. Becauſe though the word be light, yet light alone is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to cauſe ſight, but there muſt concurre un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the outward light an inward ſight: grace muſt illuminate the underſtanding and put a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light into the ſoule. As by the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in meeting with the light without, the eye being the inſtrument of ſight, applying it ſelfe to the thing, thence comes ſight. So there be divine Truthes out of us, wherewith when the Holy
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:17937:246"/> Ghoſt puts an inward light into the ſoule, ſanctified <hi>VViſdome</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward light meeting with the light without, we ſee and apprehend. The Spirit therefore muſt joyne to worke <hi>VViſdome</hi> and <hi>Prudence.</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we are all dead and have loſt our ſpirituall ſenſes, therefore the Spirit of God muſt worke in us ſpirituall ſences, ſight and taſte, that wee may ſee, diſcerne, and reliſh heavenly things; which ere we can doe, there muſt be a harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny betwixt the ſoule and the things, that is the ſoule muſt be made ſpirituall anſwerable to the heavenly things pitched upon, or elſe if the ſoule be not ſet in a ſuteable frame, it can never make a right uſe of them.</p>
                     <p>Now when the underſtanding of a man is made wiſe by the Spirit of God, it will reliſh <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Prudence.</hi> For the Spirit of God together with the Scripture takes the ſcales off the eyes of the ſoule, ſubdues rebellious paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the affections, eſpecially that rebellion of the will, putting a new reliſh in all, ſo as they come to love affect and joy in heavenly things. Now when theſe ſcales of ſpirituall blindneſſe are fallen off the eyes of the ſoule, and when rebellion is remooved from the will and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, then it is fit to joyne and approove of heavenly things, elſe there is a contrariety and Antipathy betwixt the ſoule and theſe things: as the body, when the tounge is affected with ſome aguiſh humour, cannot reliſh things, though they be never ſo good, but affects and
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:17937:247"/> relliſheth all things ſuiting that diſtemper. So it is with the ſoule when it is not inlightned, it judgeth all things carnally, there being an antipathy betweene the ſoule and divine truths brought home unto it, perhaps a ſoule not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned or ſanctified will apprehend the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallities of truth very well: but when they are preſſed home to practiſe, then unleſſe the ſoule be changed, it will riſe up and ſwell againſt divine truths, and reject the practiſe of them. Without ſubduing grace to alter and change the ſoule, the affections thereof are like the March Sunnes, which ſtirre up a great many humors, but not ſpending them, they breed aguiſh humors and diſtempers. So the light of the word in a carnall heart, it meets with the humours of the ſoule and ſtirres them; but if there be not grace in the ſoule to ſubdue theſe affections, it ſtirres them up to be the more malicious, eſpecially if they be preſt to particular duties in leaving of ſinnefull courſes: ſo that the Spirit of God muſt alter the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and ſubdue the will and affections, ere there can be a conceiving of divine truths ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly. Therefore before theſe acts, he joynes theſe graces: <hi>Who is wiſe, and who is prudent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Repentance and the knowledge of ſinne, it is a miſtery, till a man be ſanctified in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding he can never know what ſpirituall miſery is, till the inward man be inlightned and ſanctified to know what a contrariety there is betweene ſinne and the Spirit of God. As no man can know throughly what ſickneſſe is, but he that hath beene ſicke, for the Phiſitian doth not know ſickneſſe ſo well as the patient who feeles it. So it is with a holy man ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, tell him of ſinne, he feeles it, and the noiſomeneſſe of it, the oppoſition of it to his comfort and communion with God.

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:17937:249"/> to returne unto the Lord, by many and ſeverall arguments, being formerly inſiſted upon: our laſt worke was to ſhew you what <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi> was, the difference of them, and how that none without theſe endowments are able to know and make uſe of divine Truthes and miſteries of Religion. <hi>Who is wiſe and he ſhall underſtand theſe things? prudent and he ſhall know them?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>We came then to ſhew that there muſt be <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> before wee can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand divine Truthes, there muſt be an illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation within: it is not ſufficient to have the light of the Scripture outwardly, but there muſt be a light of the eye to ſee: there muſt be <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> gathered from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

Therefore when men take not Gods wayes, preſcriptions and courſes, they goe wide about, and ſeldome or never come to their intended end. Gods <hi>way</hi> is the right <hi>way,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brings a man to his right end. Sometimes men will have their turnings, their <hi>diverticula</hi> and vagaries, but they find by experience that <hi>Gods wayes</hi> they are the <hi>right wayes,</hi> ſo as they never attaine to comfort and peace untill they come againe into thoſe <hi>wayes.</hi> God untill then

                     <p>Indeed God ſuffers ſometimes men that will have their owne wayes, to come quickly to them, as ſome men haſten to be rich, and God ſuffers them to bee rich haſtily: yet they are none of Gods wayes which they take, but climbe up by fraud and deceit. I but that is only a particular end, which God ſuffereth them to attaine by bie wayes: but what will be the up-ſhot? Where will all theſe wayes end at length? ſurely in Hell. For when a man goes out of the right, and ſtreight, and direct way, to be great in the world, he is like a man vvho goes out of his way, vvhich is further about, who yet when he is in that vvay goes on through thicke and thinne, becauſe he will gaine ſome way. He goes on through thickets and hedges, faire and foule where he gets many ſcratches, bruſhes, and knocks. Do any thinke in the world to attaine his particular ends, vvithout the direct vvayes of God, God may ſuffer him to attaine his particular end, but vvith many flawes, knocks and bruſhes upon his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, vvhich many times he carrieth vvith him unto his grave, and findes it a great deale better, both to attaine unto his particular ends by <hi>Gods wayes,</hi> and to have no more of any thing in the world then he can have vvith a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                     <p>It implyes likewiſe in the ſecond place, an uniforme courſe of life. Such a one doth not duties by ſtarts now and then, but conſtantly, therefore we muſt judge of men by a tenure of life, what their conſtant wayes are: ſometimes though they be good men, they may ſtep awry into an ill way, and yet come in againe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an ill man may croſſe a good way, as a theefe when hee croſſeth the high-way: or a good man ſteps out of the way, but this is not their way, they are both out and to ſeek of their way. A wicked man when hee ſpeakes of good things he is out of his way; he acts a part and aſſumes a perſon he is unskilfull to act, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth it untowardly. But a mans way is his courſe, a good mans way is good though his ſtartings be ill, and an ill mans way is naught, though for paſſion or for bie ends, hee may now and then doe good things. Therefore conſidering that the walking in the wayes of God is uniforme and orderly: let us judge of our ſelves by the tenure of our life, and courſe thereof. And let thoſe poore ſoules who thinke they are out of the way becauſe they run into ſome infirmities now and then, comfort themſelves in this, that God judgeth not by ſingle actions, but according to the tenure of a mans life, what hee is. For often-times Gods
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:17937:262"/> children gaine by their ſlips, which makes them looke the more warily to their wayes for ever after that. He that walkes in the way to Heaven, if he be a good man, hee lookes to make ſurer footing in the wayes of God after his ſlips and falls. He labours alſo to make ſo much the more haſte home being a gainer by all his ſlips and fals. Let none therefore be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but let them labour that their wayes and courſes may be good, and not onely ſo, but to be uniforme, orderly and conſtant, and then they may ſpeake peace to their owne ſoules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as are here deſcribed, <hi>The juſt ſhall walk in them.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore let us ſtudy this point well; that there is a God and a judgement to come, and this will compell us even out of ſelfe-love to returne from our ſinnefull courſes, and make a ſtop.

<pb n="490" facs="tcp:17937:279"/> knowing his Diſciples would take his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very heavily, hee labours to arme them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aſſaults of all griefe and ſorrow that might otherwiſe oppreſſe them, and that by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arguments. Among the reſt, this is not the leaſt, that when he is gone away, he will ſend the Comforter unto them. God never takes away any thing from his children but he ſends them a better. And this Comforter whom he promiſed to ſend ſhall beare them through in all their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, all function, and in effect hee thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakes them.

                  <p>There are three maine parts of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Knowledge of our miſery, knowledge of our deliverance, and a life anſwerable. The Holy Ghoſt ſhall worke all theſe, he ſhall Convince the world of their owne ſinne, of righteouſneſſe by a Mediator, and of a reformation of life: So
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:17937:279"/> that the Holy Ghoſt ſhall goe along with you in the carriage of the whole buſineſſe of mans ſalvation. Where he begins, he makes an end. Where he Convinces of ſinne, he Convinces of righteouſneſſe, and then of a neceſſity of a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, he beares all afore him, and he doth it in a ſpirituall order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he Convinces the world of ſinne,<note place="margin">1. Convincing of ſin.</note> then of righteouſneſſe, then of judgement, becauſe it were in vaine to Convince of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, unleſſe he hath before Convinced of ſin; For who cares for balme that is not woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? Who cares for a pardon that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned? therefore he Convinces of ſin firſt. I have ſpoken heretofore of Convincing of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Here is a threefold Convincing, of ſinne, of righteouſneſſe, and of judgement, and every one of theſe hath a reaſon added thereto. <hi>Of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they beleeve not in me; Of righteouſneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I goe to my Father; Of judgement, becauſe the Prince of this world is judged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Holy Ghoſt begins with Convincing of ſin; What is this Convincing? It is a cleare and infallible demonſtration of our condition,<note place="margin">What is this Convincing.</note> It brings a commanding light into the ſoule, It ſets downe the ſoule and takes away all cavills, all turnings and windings. To convince is to make a man as the Pſalmiſts phraſe is, lay his hand upon his mouth. Light is a convincing thing, now we ſee the Sun, we ſee it is day, though ten thouſand men ſhould ſay it is not day, we would not beleeve them, becauſe the convincing herof
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:17937:280"/> is undeniable, that he muſt be an unreaſonable man that gaineſayes it.</p>
                  <p>So then, the Spirit of God brings a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding light into the ſoule undeniable; thou art thus and thus, here no ſhifting, no winding and turning will ſerve the turne, when the Holy Ghoſt comes with this light. I doe but plainely unfold this.</p>
                  <p>This Conviction of the Holy Ghoſt is not in generall onely, that all men are ſinners, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and ſtrong, thou art a ſinner, and thou art in danger of damnation; And it is univerſall, taking in ſins of nature, ſins of life, ſins of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, will, and affections, and it is not of ſinne onely, but of the miſery by ſinne, of the danger, folly, and madneſſe of ſinne, and of the aggravations that greaten ſinne: as of ſtifling ſo many good motions, withſtanding ſo many meanes, abuſing ſo many mercies. The Holy Ghoſt Convinces us throughly, that wee can have nothing to reply. Becauſe I have ſpoken of this before, I am ſhort. Beloved, unleſſe the Holy Ghoſt Convince, there will be no Convincing, our deceitfull hearts have ſo many windings and turnings; proud nature armes it ſelfe with defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as a hedge-hogg winds himſelfe round and defends himſelf by his pricks. So you have many cloath themſelves with ſtrong words, ill tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon others, frivolous mitigations, the way of the multitude, as with a coate of male to keep out this Conviction, that did not the Holy Ghoſt ſtrike in hard with their conſciences, Thou art
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:17937:280"/> the man; this worke would never bee done.</p>

The Conviction of the Spirit is the light of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is of a higher nature then that of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conſcience, I will ſend the Comforter,

                     </label> Come we therefore to make ſome Uſe. The Spirit doth Convince of ſinne. But how? by the Miniſtery ordinarily, though not alone by the Miniſtery. Therefore we muſt labour willingly to ſubmit to the Miniſtery Convincing of ſinne. Conſcience will Convince firſt or laſt. Is it not better to have a ſaving Conviction now to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, then to have a bare deſperate Conviction in Hell. O beloved all the admonitions wee heare, if we regard them not now, we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, therefore labour to make good uſe of this Sword of the Spirit of God, and it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a good heart to wiſh, O that the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might meet with my corruption, that it may be diſcovered to me to the full. A true heart thinkes ſin the greateſt enemy, and of all other miſeries it deſires to bee freed from the thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome thereof; For that defiles Heaven and Earth and ſeparates God from his creature. Its that that threw Angels out of Heaven, <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradice. What imbitters bleſſings and puts a ſting into all afflictions but ſin? if it were not for ſin we would take up any croſſe, and beare any affliction more quietly then we doe.</p>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:17937:281"/>
                  <p>Therefore as we deſire to be ſaved, and to ſtand with comfort before God at the day of judgement, let us deſire and indeavour to bee throughly Convinced of ſinne. Take heed of reſiſting the Spirit of God in the Miniſtery: why are ſo many led captive of their luſts, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hate the Miniſtery of the Word, they looke upon it as <hi>Ahab</hi> did upon <hi>Elias,</hi> Haſt thou found me, O my Enemy. They natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are in love with their ſinnes, and there is none ſo much hated as thoſe that preſent themſelves to themſelves. A man take him in his pure naturalls is a fooliſh creature, his heart riſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conviction. You ſee the Phariſees, Wiſe men, Learned men, being convinced they hated Chriſt to the death; why?<note place="margin">Mat. 23.27.</note> becauſe he did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombe them and diſcover the dead mens bones within. So many now a daies that are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, hate any that by life or ſpeech diſcover their ſinne unto them, if it were poſſible and in their power to the death. Thus the Holy Ghoſt convinces of ſin. But before I leave this point, let me adde this from the reaſon or ground of this Conviction <hi>[becauſe they beleeve not in me]</hi> That unbeleefe makes all other ſinnes damnable, no ſinne is damnable if we could beleeve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Therefore we are convinced of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we doe not beleeve: as we ſay of a man that is condemned, becauſe he cannot reade, therefore he is condemned, he ſhould eſcape if he could reade being for no great fault; ſo it is here, it is not beleeving in Chriſt and repenting
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:17937:282"/> makes all other ſins deadly.</p>
                  <p>The differing of one man from another is their faith and repentance, ſome there be whoſe ſinnes are greater then others, yet by the Spirit of God and Faith, they worke them out every day. It is faith in the brazen Serpent that takes away the ſting of the fiery Serpents.</p>
                  <p>J have done with the conviction of ſinne. Let us now come to ſpeake of the conviction of Righteouſneſſe.</p>

Beloved, ſince we have meanes of ſuch a gift, let us never reſt till wee have it. If Satan ſet upon us, hold this out, if he tell thee thou art a ſinner, tell him I have a greater righteouſneſſe then my owne, even the righteouſneſſe of God-Man, I have a righteouſneſſe above all my unrighteouſneſſe.

                  <p>Againe, where this conviction of righteouſnes is, it anſwers all objections, the doubting heart will object this and that, but the Spirit of God ſhewes an All-ſufficiency in Chriſts obedience, and that ſets the ſoule downe quietly in all croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

                     </label> To end the point, I beſeech you labour to live by this faith, heere is an evidence if we can live by it? How is that? Every day to make uſe of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, as every day we run into ſinne. Be ſure we have our conſciences ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt, that as we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe new guilt, ſo we may have a new pardon, therefore every day labour to ſee God as recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, and Chriſt as our Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Chriſt is now in Heaven, if we ſinne, make uſe of him, this ſhould be the life of a Chriſtian, to make uſe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe; when you finde nature polluted, goe to God, and ſay, Lord my nature though foule in it ſelfe, yet is holy and pure in Chriſt, He tooke the weakneſſe of the humane nature unto him that hee might communicate the worth and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his divine nature unto me, and for my actions I am a ſinner, but Chriſt hath fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all my debts, and is now in Heaven, he hath performed all righteouſneſſe for me. Looke not upon mee as in my ſelfe, but looke
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:17937:288"/> upon me in Chriſt, He and I am one. This ſhould bee every daies exerciſe to ſee our ſelves in Chriſt, and ſo ſee him and our ſelves one. I ſhould inlarge the point further, but I will ſpeake a word of the reaſon.</p>
                  <p>What is the reaſon why the Comforter may and ſhall convince of righteouſneſſe? <hi>Becauſe I go to the Father;</hi> what ſtrength is there in that reaſon? why this, Chriſt took upon him to be our ſurety, and he muſt acquit us of all our ſins ere he can go to his Father? If one ſinne had beene unſatisfied for he could not have gone to his Father, but now he is gone to his Father, therfore all our ſins are ſatisfied for, ſo that now the Aſcention of Chriſt is a ſufficient pledge to me that my perſon is accepted, and my ſins pardoned, becauſe he is gone to his Father to appeare before the Father for us, which he could not have done, had he not fulfilled all righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>But wherefore did he go to the Father? why, to make application of what he had wrought. If Chriſt ſhould not have gone to the Father, he could not have ſent the Holy Ghoſt to us. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is great uſe of this going to his Father. Satan pleads before God we are ſuch and ſuch, I but ſaith Chriſt I have ſhed my blood for them, and there he perfumes all our weake prayers; if we were not imperfect what need we a Mediator in Heaven. Therefore he is gone to Heaven to diſanull all Satans accuſations, and to provide a place for us; die when wee will, our place is ready.</p>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:17937:288"/>
                  <p>Then againe he is gone to the Father to cloath us with a ſweet relation, to make the Father our Father. For he ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.17. <hi>I goe to my Father and to your Father;</hi> So that he is not aſhamed to call us Brethren, by vertue of this wee may goe to God and call him Father, and when wee die wee may without preſumption ſay; Father into thy hands I commend my ſpirit, for the Father loves us as hee loved Chriſt, with one and the ſame love, though in a farre different degree. What a comfort is this, that when we die, we goe to our Father that is better then any earthly Father; Therfore it ſhould joy us when the time of our departure comes: We ſee old <hi>Iacob</hi> when he ſaw the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots come out of Aegypt, how his heart leaped becauſe he ſhould go to ſee his Sonne <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> So when death is ſent to tranſport us to Chriſt, to Heaven, had we a ſtrong faith we ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad.</p>
                  <p>And let us learne here the art of faith from Chriſt, <hi>I go to the Father,</hi> ſaith he, there was a great deale of time yet to paſſe, no leſſe then forty daies after his Reſurrection before hee went to the Father, yet he ſaith, I goe to the Father, to ſhew that faith preſents things future as preſent; Faith ſees Heaven as preſent, and the day of judgement as preſent, and doth affect the ſoule as if they were now exiſtent. If we had a Spirit of faith it would thus preſent things farre off as nigh at hand. Therfore when we meet with any thing that may make our way to Heaven ſeeme long or
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:17937:289"/> troubleſome, exerciſe your faith, and make your terme preſent to your ſpirit though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from ſence, ſay I goe to the Father, what though I goe through blood and a ſhamefull death, yea perhaps a tormentfull death: yet I goe to the Father; when a man is once perſwaded that God is his Father in Chriſt, it will make him walke to Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Vſe."/> Let us make Uſe of this point of Chriſts going to the Father. Beloved, there is not a point of Religion but hath a wonderfull ſpring of comfort, and it is want of faith that wee doe not draw more comfort from them. When therefore wee part with our friends by death, thinke they are gone to their Father. If yee loved me ſaith Chriſt, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I ſaid <hi>I goe to the Father.</hi> If we love our friends, we ſhould rejoyce when they die; Beloved, this ſhould comfort us, Chriſt is gone to his Father, O what welcome was there of Chriſt when he came into Heaven, the ſame welcome will there be when we goe to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? How joyfull intertainement ſhall we have of the Father and the Sonne? Therefore death ſhould not bee troubleſome to us, ſay Chriſts righteouſneſſe is mine, therefore I know I ſhall go to the Father, what care I then what kind of paines I goe through. If a man be going to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired place, howſoever the way be troubleſome, the ſweetneſſe of the end will make him forget the diſcouragements of his paſſage. Perhaps
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:17937:289"/> wee muſt wade to Heaven through a Sea of blood, it matters not, the end will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence all, though we loſe our limbes by the way: It is better to limpe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then dance to Hell.</p>
